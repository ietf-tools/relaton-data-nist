abstract:
- content: The web-based tool Fate and Transport of Indoor Microbiological Aerosols
    (FaTIMA) allows the determination of the fate of indoor microbiological aerosols
    associated with ventilation, filtration, deposition, and inactivation mechanisms.
    FaTIMA provides a representation of a single, well-mixed zone that is served by
    a mechanical ventilation system and incorporates source and removal mechanisms
    for an aerosol with a single, user-defined representative particle size. The simple
    mechanical ventilation system model allows specification of supply, return, and
    outdoor air intake rates to represent either a positive, negative or balanced
    ventilation system. Aerosol sources are provided to enable any combination of
    continuous, e.g., breathing-related emissions, or intermittent, e.g., coughing-related
    emissions. Aerosol removal mechanisms include filters within the ventilation system,
    room air cleaners, and deposition onto floors, walls, and ceilings. Simulations
    can be run for a 24-h period, with the results including the time history of the
    airborne concentration and surface loading, as well as integrated exposure of
    an occupant. Exposure is based on a uniform aerosol concentration within the zone
    and does not account for spatial differences in aerosol concentrations such as
    those due to momentum effects of respiratory emissions.
