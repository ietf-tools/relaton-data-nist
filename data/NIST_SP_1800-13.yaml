abstract:
- content: On-demand access to public safety data is critical to ensuring that public
    safety and first responders (PSFRs) can protect life and property during an emergency.
    This public safety information, often needing to be accessed via mobile or portable
    devices, routinely includes sensitive information, such as personally identifiable
    information, law enforcement sensitive information, and protected health information.
    Because the communications are critical to public safety and may include sensitive
    information, robust and reliable authentication mechanisms that do not hinder
    delivery of emergency services are required. In collaboration with the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research
    laboratory and industry stakeholders, the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence
    (NCCoE) at NIST built a laboratory environment to demonstrate standards-based
    technologies that can enable PSFRs to gain access to public safety information
    efficiently and securely by using mobile devices. The technologies demonstrated
    are currently available and include (1) single sign-on (SSO) capabilities that
    reduce the number of credentials that need to be managed by public safety personnel,
    and reduce the time and effort that individuals spend authenticating themselves;
    (2) identity federation that can improve the ability to authenticate personnel
    across public safety organization (PSO) boundaries; and (3) multifactor authentication
    (MFA) that enables authentication with a high level of assurance.
