abstract:
- content: The NISTIR 8011 capability-specific volumes focus on the automation of
    security control assessment within each individual information security capability.
    They add tangible detail to the more general overview given in NISTIR 8011 Volume
    1, providing a template for transition to a detailed, NIST standards-compliant
    automated assessment. This document, Volume 4 of NISTIR 8011, addresses the management
    of risk created by defects present in software on the network. Software vulnerability
    management, in the scope of this document, focuses on known defects that have
    been discovered in software in use on a system. The Common Weakness Enumeration
    (CWE) provides identifiers for weaknesses that result from poor coding practices
    and have the potential to result in software vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities
    and Exposures (CVEs) program provides a list of many known vulnerabilities. Together,
    CVE and CWE are used to identify software defects and the weaknesses that caused
    a given defect. Vulnerable software is a key target that attackers use to initiate
    an attack internally and to expand control. Patching vulnerabilities discovered
    in existing software and improving coding practices for future releases of software
    are two ways to limit the success of attacks.
