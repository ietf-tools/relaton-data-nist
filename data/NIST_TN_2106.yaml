abstract:
- content: This document details methods to compare instrument performance. Comparison
    methods for instruments outputting binary (0-1) responses as well as for instruments
    outputting continuous numeric responses are shown, first for two instruments and
    then for multiple instruments. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for instrument
    differences are demonstrated. Several nonparametric procedures are shown along
    with reasons why they might be needed. Finally, equivalence testing is demonstrated
    for those cases where testing for equivalence rather than for differences is indicated.
