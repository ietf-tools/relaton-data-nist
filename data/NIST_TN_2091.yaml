abstract:
- content: The SARS-CoV-2 virus has put a strain on the supply and distribution of
    N95 masks, with some hospitals electing to reuse masks after disinfection. Currently,
    vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) mask disinfection systems are being deployed
    at multiple locations throughout the United States, for example in shipping containers
    and in small rooms. Such enclosures will be of a different size, have different
    surface materials and have varying air change rates; all these parameters will
    impact the VHP dose that the masks receive. This paper describes a spreadsheet
    tool to estimate the VHP concentration in air of such a room. The tool employs
    a single-zone mass balance analysis that accounts for room size, VHP losses to
    surfaces and air change rate. This tool is intended to support VHP disinfection
    efforts by providing estimates of VHP concentrations in the room being employed,
    but it does not describe or provide guidance on VHP disinfection applications.
