abstract:
- content: In August 2018, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
    the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WaterSense program, and the Water
    Research Foundation (WRF) organized a Measurement Science Roadmap Workshop for
    Water Use Efficiency and Water Quality in Premise Plumbing Systems (hereafter
    referred to as the Premise Plumbing Workshop) with representatives from industry,
    academia, government, utilities, standards and codes organizations, and other
    research and stakeholder organizations. The intent of the workshop was to identify
    and organize measurement science research needed to improve the efficiency and
    quality of water delivered by premise plumbing systems. The workshop results,
    along with feedback from stakeholder engagement efforts, will form the basis for
    potential future program development within multiple public and private sector
    agencies and organizations.
