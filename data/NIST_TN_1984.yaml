abstract:
- content: This report documents two series of compartment fire experiments in which
    a natural gas burner is positioned in a corner, or against a wall, or inside a
    steel cabinet, to assess the effects on the plume and compartment temperatures.
    The measurements consist of one dimensional vertical thermocouple arrays to measure
    the hot gas layer temperature and height, and a three dimensional thermocouple
    array to measure the temperature of the fire plume as the burner is moved away
    from the corner or wall. The primary purpose of the experiments is to provide
    validation data for fire modeling analyses of these effects.
