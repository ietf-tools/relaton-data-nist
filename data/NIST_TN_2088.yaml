abstract:
- content: The purpose of this report is to identify measurement science research
    needs that are critical to the design of new premise plumbing systems and the
    operation and retrofit of existing systems to achieve the goals of water and energy
    efficiency and water quality in an integrated manner. The scope of this research
    needs assessment includes engineering issues related to system design and operation,
    and is motivated by the trends and drivers outlined above, particularly the need
    to update design methods, data, standards, and building codes to reflect the need
    to increase water efficiency and maintain water quality. The research needs do
    not focus on water quality, except to the degree that system design, operation,
    and maintenance impact these processes and the resultant water quality. The research
    needs also exclude water treatment processes and distribution systems serving
    buildings, except as these processes and systems impact conditions within buildings.
    The measurement science research needs in this report were identified with involvement
    of the broader stakeholder community as described below. While not intended to
    solely focus on needs in the United States, it should be noted that nearly all
    the input to this report was gained through interactions with U.S. stakeholders.
