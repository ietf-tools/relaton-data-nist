abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in the process
    of selecting one or more authenticated encryption and hashing schemes suitable
    for constrained environments through a public, competition-like process. In February
    2019, 57 candidate algorithms were submitted to NIST for consideration. Among
    these, 56 were accepted as first-round candidates in April 2019, marking the beginning
    of the first round of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization Process.
    Due to the large number of submissions and the short timeline of the process,
    NIST has decided to eliminate some of the algorithms from consideration early
    in the first evaluation phase in order to focus analysis on the more promising
    submissions. This report describes the evaluation criteria and selection process
    based on public feedback and internal review of the first-round candidates and
    provides the list of 32 candidate algorithms selected for the second round of
    the evaluation process.
