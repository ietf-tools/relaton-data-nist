abstract:
- content: With the development of storage, transmission, editing, and sharing tools,
    digital forgery images are propagating rapidly. The need for image provenance
    analysis has never been more timely. Typical applications are content tracking,
    copyright enforcement, and forensics reasoning. However, large-scale image provenance
    datasets, which contain diverse manipulation history graphs with various manipulation
    operations and rich metadata, are still needed to facilitate the research. It
    is one of the major factors that hinders the development of techniques for image
    provenance analysis. To address this issue, we introduce large-scale benchmark
    datasets for provenance analysis, namely Media Forensics Challenge-Provenance
    (MFC-Prov) datasets. Two provenance tasks are designed along with evaluation metrics.
    Furthermore, extensive analysis is conducted for system performance in terms of
    accuracy on our datasets.
