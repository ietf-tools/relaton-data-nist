abstract:
- content: The document describes the procedure by which applications of JPEG 2000
    CODECs will be evaluated with respect to conformance to the NIST guidance for
    compression of 1000 ppi friction ridge images as detailed in NIST Special Publication
    500-289 [NIST3]. The document describes the attributes of a set of fingerprint
    images selected for conformance testing and the rationale for selection of these
    images based on both examiner assessment of image quality over increasing degrees
    of JPEG 2000 compression and relative fidelity based on computational metrics
    described SP 500-289 and supporting studies. The document provides background
    behind the conformance testing, describes the CODEC pathways to be tested and
    the metrics used to measure conformance, and provides instructions on how to run
    the protocol and submit results to NIST for evaluation.
