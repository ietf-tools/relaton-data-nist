abstract:
- content: This document summarizes the research performed by the members of the NIST
    Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group, and aggregates, categorizes, and
    discusses the forensics challenges faced by experts when responding to incidents
    that have occurred in a cloud-computing ecosystem. The challenges are presented
    along with the associated literature that references them. The immediate goal
    of the document is to begin a dialogue on forensic science concerns in cloud computing
    ecosystems. The long-term goal of this effort is to gain a deeper understanding
    of those concerns (challenges) and to identify technologies and standards that
    can mitigate them.
