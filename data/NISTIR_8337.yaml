abstract:
- content: 'This user guide describes an integrated set of C++ software tools for
    manipulating XML (eXtensible Markup Language) schemas and XML instance files.
    The tools are: - xmlSchemaParser - parses and reformats XML schema files, prints
    type derivation hierarchies - xmlInstanceParserGenerator - generates C++ classes
    and a YACC/Lex instance file parser from an XML schema - it''s a software tool
    that writes software tools - orphanFinder - identifies unused types and undefined
    types in one to many XML schema files - xmlSchemaAttributeConverter - rewrites
    an XML schema file, converting attributes to elements All of the tools are invoked
    by giving a command in a terminal window. The tools were built at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology. The xmlSchemaParser and the xmlInstanceParserGenerator
    were originally built in support of the Agility Performance of Robotic Systems
    project. They have been greatly extended since that time. The orphanFinder and
    xmlSchemaAttributeConverter are more recent.'
