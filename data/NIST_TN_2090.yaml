abstract:
- content: A lump-capacitance heat transfer model was developed to model the operation
    of a slug calorimeter constructed of metal with a Curie point. The resulting formula
    has been successfully used to infer total heat flux to a metal structural member
    in a fire by temporally monitoring the internal temperature rise during the heat-up
    phase of the metal member (slug) with embedded thermocouples. The formula derived
    is applicable to slug calorimeters made from metals with or without a Curie point.
