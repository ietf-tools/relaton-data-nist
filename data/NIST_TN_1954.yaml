abstract:
- content: We describe measurements to create a library of high-fidelity waveforms
    of federal incumbent radar signals currently operating in the 3550 MHz - 3650
    MHz (3.5 GHz) band. In the first phase of assembling this library, measurements
    were collected at Point Loma continuously over a two- month period. The measurements
    consist of 60-second power spectral measurements collected every 10 minutes as
    well as high-resolution in-phase and quadrature sampled waveforms covering the
    entire band in question and portions of adjacent bands. The spectral measurements
    were used to characterize normal and anomalous behaviors. A subset of the high-resolution
    I/Q waveforms containing no adjacent-band or other in-band emissions was selected
    for statistical analysis of key parameters of the target radar that could aid
    detection, namely, the antenna rotation period, pulse repetition interval, pulse
    duration, and center frequency. The subset of approximately 800 acquisitions of
    in-band radar consisted of about 12 000 sweeps of the main beam and nearly 223
    000 individual pulses ranging in peak power by over 40 dB. Distributions of the
    parameters are reported along with percentiles.
