abstract:
- content: In this work, we compiled and evaluated various properties pertaining to
    the heats of combustion of about 420 compounds of physical, chemical, and engineering
    interest. This includes boiling points, melting points, latent heats (enthalpies)
    of vaporization, heats (enthalpies) of fusion, heats (enthalpies) of formation
    and combustion, and heat capacities (specific heats).
