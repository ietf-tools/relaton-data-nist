abstract:
- content: The SRM 114 series for portland cement fineness has been provided by NIST
    since 1934 for use in calibrating instruments for measuring fineness characteristics
    of portland cement and other powdered construction materials. SRM 114r is the
    latest of this series providing certified values for cement fineness by Blaine
    apparatus, + 45 ?m (No. 325) Sieve, and informational values for particle size
    distribution by light scattering. ASTM C01.25 Committee on Fineness provided a
    range of desired materials properties, and the assistance of the Cement and Concrete
    Reference Lab provided a number of candidate plants with materials conforming
    to the Committee request. Approximately 1000 kg of cement was procured, homogenized,
    and packaged. An inter-laboratory study was initiated to develop the data set
    used to establish certified values. The certified values represent the consensus
    means and uncertainties for the Blaine and + 45 ?m residue. Informational values
    on particle size distribution are provided as the mean of the combined wet and
    dry laser diffraction data.
