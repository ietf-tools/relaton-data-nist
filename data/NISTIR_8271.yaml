abstract:
- content: 'This report updates and extends NIST Interagency Report 8238, documenting
    performance of new face recognition algorithms submitted for evaluation to NIST
    in November 2018. The algorithms implement one-to-many identification of faces
    appearing in two- dimensional images. Three datasets were used - the primary dataset
    is comprised of 26.6 mil- lion reasonably well-controlled live portrait photos
    of 12.3 million individuals. Three smaller datasets containing more unconstrained
    photos are also used: 200 thousand side-view images; 3.2 million webcam images;
    2.5 million photojournalism and amateur photographer photos. The report will be
    useful for comparison of face recognition algorithms and assessment of absolute
    capability. There is an additional appendix to this NISTIR, which contains individual
    reporting for each algorithm submitted to FRVT 1:N. These report cards are available
    at: https://nfiles.nist.gov/w/dEmFbwW2'
