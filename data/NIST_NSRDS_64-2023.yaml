abstract:
- content: Version 5.0 of the database was released in December 2023. Most screens
    were redesigned. An option was added to provide samplers of polar elastic-scattering
    angles that can be used in Monte Carlo simulations of electron transport in solids
    (as was possible in Version 3.2 and earlier versions). However, a more accurate
    numerical method has been implemented in Version 5.0, as described in Appendix
    A. The new sampler is designed to generate scattering angles for electron energies
    between 50 eV and 20 keV. The differential elastic-scattering cross sections (DCSs)
    were calculated using the relativistic Dirac partial-wave method, as described
    by Walker [3]. The scattering potential was obtained from the self-consistent
    Dirac-Hartree-Fock electron density for free atoms [4] with the local exchange
    potential of Furness and McCarthy [5]. The numerical calculations were performed
    with the algorithm described by Salvat and Mayol [6]. Transport cross sections
    were calculated from the DCSs as described by Jablonski et al. [1].
