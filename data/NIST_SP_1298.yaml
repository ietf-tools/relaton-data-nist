abstract:
- content: This report describes the development of standards for radioactivity and
    x rays in the US during the first two decades of the 20th century. The first standards
    for radium were pioneered by chemists in industry and academia. The US national
    standards were established at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    on receipt of a radium standard from Marie Curie and the International Radium
    Standards Commission in 1913. During World War I, the NIST began development of
    standards for self-luminescent dials and watches containing radium paint, and
    standards for x-rays to support the US industry for protective materials against
    x rays and radium. Marie Curieâ€™s 1921 visit to the NIST to receive a gram of radium
    funded by donations from the women of America is described.
