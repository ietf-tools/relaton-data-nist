abstract:
- content: Internet of Things (IoT) devices often lack device cybersecurity capabilities
    their customers organizations and individuals can use to help mitigate their cybersecurity
    risks. Manufacturers can help their customers by improving how securable the IoT
    devices they make are by providing necessary cybersecurity functionality and by
    providing customers with the cybersecurity-related information they need. This
    publication describes recommended activities related to cybersecurity that manufacturers
    should consider performing before their IoT devices are sold to customers. These
    foundational cybersecurity activities can help manufacturers lessen the cybersecurity-related
    efforts needed by customers, which in turn can reduce the prevalence and severity
    of IoT device compromises and the attacks performed using compromised devices.
