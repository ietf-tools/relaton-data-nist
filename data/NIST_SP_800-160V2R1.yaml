abstract:
- content: NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-160, Volume 2, Revision 1, focuses on
    cyber resiliency engineering an emerging specialty systems engineering discipline
    applied in conjunction with systems security engineering and resilience engineering
    to develop survivable, trustworthy secure systems. Cyber resiliency engineering
    intends to architect, design, develop, implement, maintain, and sustain the trustworthiness
    of systems with the capability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt
    to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises that use or are enabled
    by cyber resources. From a risk management perspective, cyber resiliency is intended
    to help reduce the mission, business, organizational, enterprise or sector risk
    of depending on cyber resources. This publication can be used in conjunction with
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, Systems and software engineering Systems life cycle processes,
    NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-160, Volume 1, Systems Security Engineering
    Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy
    Secure Systems, NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems
    and Organizations A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy; and NIST
    SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations.
    It can be viewed as a handbook for achieving the identified cyber resiliency outcomes
    based on a systems engineering perspective on system life cycle and risk management
    processes, allowing the experience and expertise of the implementing organization
    to help determine how the content will be used for its purpose. Organizations
    can select, adapt, and use some or all of the cyber resiliency constructs (i.e.,
    goals, objectives, techniques, approaches, and design principles) described in
    this publication and apply the constructs to the technical, operational, and threat
    environments for which systems need to be engineered.
