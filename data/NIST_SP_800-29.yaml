abstract:
- content: 'Federal agencies, industry, and the public now rely on cryptography to
    protect information and communications used in critical infrastructures, electronic
    commerce, and other application areas. Cryptographic modules are implemented in
    these products and systems to provide cryptographic services such as confidentiality,
    integrity, non-repudiation and identification and authentication. A documented
    methodology for conformance testing through a defined set of security requirements
    in FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2 and other cryptographic standards is specified in
    the Derived Test Requirements.FIPS 140-1 is one of NIST''s most successful standards
    and forms the very foundation of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program.
    FIPS 140-2 addresses lessons learned from questions and comments and reflects
    changes in technology. The standard was strengthened, but not changed in focus
    or emphasis. Also, the standard was minimally restructured to: standardize the
    language and terminology to add clarity and consistency; remove redundant and
    extraneous information to make the standard more concise; and revise or remove
    vague requirements. Finally, a new section was added detailing new types of attacks
    on cryptographic modules that currently do not have specific testing available.
    This differences paper summarizes the changes from FIPS 140-1 to FIPS 140-2 and
    documents the detailed requirements.'
