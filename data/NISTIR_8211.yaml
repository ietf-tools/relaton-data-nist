abstract:
- content: New software, in the form of Microsoft Excel 2016 spreadsheets, has been
    created for the analysis and qualification of Charpy Verification Lots, to be
    used by personnel of the Charpy Verification Program at NIST in Boulder, Colorado.
    The new spreadsheets replace the previously used statistical software (in SYSTAT
    and R-code), adding a more detailed outlier analysis. Of the two spreadsheet templates,
    the first one assesses the acceptability of a Charpy pilot or production lot by
    calculating its sample size and identifying statistical outliers. The second spreadsheet
    establishes the reference value of absorbed energy and the associated uncertainty
    for the whole Charpy Verification Lot. Both spreadsheets have been checked and
    validated against calculations performed on several lots by means of the previously
    used R-language codes, which had been prepared by Jolene Splett of the Statistical
    Engineering Division of NIST.
