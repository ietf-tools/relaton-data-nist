abstract:
- content: Updates to the underlying cost and environmental data have recently been
    implemented in the BIRDS database. This study evaluates the updated results for
    validation, as well as determines the potential changes in the results relative
    to those found in O'Rear, Webb, Kneifel and O'Fallon (1). The updates are found
    to have a minor impact on the total LCC and the LCA results, but there is a shift
    in some energy efficiency measures (EEMs) in optimal designs. The continued reduction
    in solar photovoltaic (PV) installation costs leads to larger system sizes being
    utilized in life-cycle cost (LCC) designs, while including few additional EEMs.
    Reducing the efficiency of some building components is possible and still reaching
    net-zero energy performance. As in the previous study, net-zero energy performance
    is reached at the lowest LCC using an all-electric design. The incremental increase
    in initial construction costs relative to the code-compliant design in Maryland
    is $28222, which has continued a trend in decreasing premium for net-zero energy
    performance. Over the 30-year study period, NZLCC-E saves the homeowner $34063.
    Although the homeowner could save more designing to meet the lowest LCC design
    using natural gas heating (LCC-NG), the additional savings is only $527 while
    still consuming about 50 % of the baseline building design s total energy. The
    concept of low-energy buildings must be reconsidered to determine whether new
    targets should be set, such as a combination of total consumption and net consumption
    or net-zero goals that include embodied energy. These results are limited in their
    generalization because they are based on a case study using validated simulation
    models of the NIST Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF). The findings
    should not be extrapolated to buildings with different climates, energy costs,
    building codes, or occupancies. The assumptions on the economic analysis are also
    important factors to consider when using the results and implications in this
    study for decision making. The baseline building designs in this study are based
    on 2015 IECC. Maryland has since adopted 2018 IECC, which would influence the
    relative differences between the optimal designs and the baseline.
