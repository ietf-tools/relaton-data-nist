abstract:
- content: Despite widespread recognition that patching is effective and attackers
    regularly exploit unpatched software, many organizations do not adequately patch.
    There are myriad reasons why, not the least of which are that it's resource-intensive
    and that the act of patching can reduce system and service availability. Also,
    many organizations struggle to prioritize patches, test patches before deployment,
    and adhere to policies for how quickly patches are applied in different situations.
    To address these challenges, the NCCoE is collaborating with cybersecurity technology
    providers to develop an example solution that addresses these challenges. This
    NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide explains how tools can be used to implement
    the patching and inventory capabilities organizations need to handle both routine
    and emergency patching situations, as well as implement workarounds, isolation
    methods, or other alternatives to patching. It also explains recommended security
    practices for patch management systems themselves.
