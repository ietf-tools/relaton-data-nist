abstract:
- content: Augmented reality (AR) technology is developing at a fast pace. Usability
    evaluation methodologies for AR need to be updated to accommodate the increasing
    complexity of AR technology. Eye tracking metrics, which have been historically
    successful in traditional, often computer-based technology, have been underutilized
    when evaluating AR devices. Literature review shows documentation of usability
    methodology used to evaluate AR since 2000. But these reviews did not address
    the reasons why evaluators have chosen or excluded certain methods, like eye tracking.
    They also did not address certain evaluations, such as those performed in the
    industry sector, which are not typically published. This exploratory study addressed
    these gaps by deploying semi-structured interviews to gain an understanding of
    the experiences professionals have when evaluating AR technology. Our results
    show that participants rely most heavily on user feedback and questionnaires/surveys
    during evaluation. Most participants did not use eye tracking methods. They cited
    a number of challenges evaluating AR technology and the use of eye tracking, including
    difficulties in data collection and a lack of consistency and standards across
    devices.
