abstract:
- content: In today's cloud data centers and edge computing, attack surfaces have
    significantly increased, hacking has become industrialized, and most security
    control implementations are not coherent or consistent. The foundation of any
    data center or edge computing security strategy should be securing the platform
    on which data and workloads will be executed and accessed. The physical platform
    represents the first layer for any layered security approach and provides the
    initial protections to help ensure that higher-layer security controls can be
    trusted. This report explains an approach based on hardware-enabled security techniques
    and technologies for safeguarding container deployments in multi-tenant cloud
    environments. It also describes a proof-of-concept implementation of the approach
    a prototype that is intended to be a blueprint or template for the general security
    community.
