abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the tenth
    installment of the Model-Based Enterprise Summit (MBE 2019) on April 2-4, 2019
    in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The MBE 2019 witnessed another year-over-year registration
    and attendance growth. The MBE Summit saw 340 attendees gather over three days
    to share their experiences with Model-Based Enterprise (MBE). This speaks to the
    growing interest of MBE within the community and the importance of the Summit
    output. The MBE 2019 Program Committee continues to believe that the MBE Summit
    is the best place for gathering and sharing information dedicated to the digital
    transformation across the product lifecycle. The goal of the MBE Summit is to
    identify challenges, research, implementation issues, and lessons learned in design,
    manufacturing, quality assurance, and sustainment of products and processes where
    a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as the authoritative
    information source for all activities in a product s lifecycle. The theme of MBE
    2019 was Democratizing the Implementation of MBE. The model-based community moved
    beyond the question of why is MBE important? to how do we deploy MBE? . The tenth
    MBE Summit was focused on highlighting the long history of MBE and real-world
    implementations of MBE in practice. Authors from academia, government, and industry
    submitted papers on topics related to this year s theme using the following tracks:
    1) Systems Engineering and Lifecycle Management; 2) Design; 3) Manufacturing;
    4) Quality and Inspection; and 5) Operations, Logistics, and Sustainment. This
    volume contains the papers presented at MBE 2019. There were 58 submissions. Each
    submission was reviewed by experts and decided upon by the program committee.
    The committee decided to accept 30 papers. The MBE 2019 program also included
    five invited talks and three panels.'
