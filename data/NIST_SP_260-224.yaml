abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM) 3655 is intended primarily for use as
    a calibration standard for the measurement of enzymatically released N-linked
    glycans. Applications of SRM 3655 include the benchmarking and comparability of
    analytical techniques, as a material for ensuring system suitability, and for
    analytical method validation. This material may also be used to value-assign in-house
    calibrators or control materials. SRM 3655 consists of thirteen (13) aqueous solutions
    of glycans commonly associated with monoclonal antibody therapeutics. Each solution
    contains a purified, free-reducing glycan at a defined mass fraction. A unit of
    SRM 3655 consists of thirteen 0.5 mL vials each containing approximately 0.2 mL
    of solution, frozen and stored at -80 C. The tube is labeled and is sealed with
    a color-coded screw cap with a Teflon liner. This publication documents the production,
    analytical methods, measurement results, and statistical evaluations involved
    in characterizing these glycan materials.
