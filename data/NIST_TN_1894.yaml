abstract:
- content: A series of experiments was conducted to examine fire spread along fences
    subjected to wind at various speeds and angles. Specifically, sections of western
    redcedar, California redwood, or vinyl privacy fences were ignited with a burner.
    Wind fields of 9 m/s, 13.5 m/s, or 18 m/s aligned with, perpendicular to, or at
    a 45 angle to the fences were applied during the experiments. To simulate fine
    fuels typically present in real installations, dried shredded hardwood mulch beds
    were placed under most of the fence sections. Also, some fence sections were coated
    with fence preservative to assess its effect on fire spread. Pans of mulch were
    downwind targets for firebrands produced by the burning fence and mulch bed. At
    all wind speeds tested, a mulch bed was required for flames to spread. Fastest
    flame spread was achieved with the fence aligned with the wind field. During most
    experiments, the burning mulch and fences produced firebrands which ignited spot
    fires in the mulch targets. These experiments demonstrated that ignited wood fence
    structures can be rapid conduits for fire along them and potentially spread fire
    to attached or adjacent structures. Additionally, it was found that burning fences
    can produce spot fires from their own firebrand generation. This study of fence
    fire spread is part of a series designed to better inform standards and codes
    regarding placement of landscape features around homes at risk of exposure to
    wildland-urban interface fires.
