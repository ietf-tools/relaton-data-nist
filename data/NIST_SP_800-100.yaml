abstract:
- content: This Information Security Handbook provides a broad overview of information
    security program elements to assist managers in understanding how to establish
    and implement an information security program. Typically, the organization looks
    to the program for overall responsibility to ensure the selection and implementation
    of appropriate security controls and to demonstrate the effectiveness of satisfying
    their stated security requirements. The topics within this document were selected
    based on the laws and regulations relevant to information security, including
    the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the Federal Information Security Management Act
    (FISMA) of 2002, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130. The
    material in this handbook can be referenced for general information on a particular
    topic or can be used in the decision making process for developing an information
    security program. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Interagency
    Report (IR) 7298, Glossary of Key Information Security Terms, provides a summary
    glossary for the basic security terms used throughout this document. While reading
    this handbook, please consider that the guidance is not specific to a particular
    agency. Agencies should tailor this guidance according to their security posture
    and business requirements.
