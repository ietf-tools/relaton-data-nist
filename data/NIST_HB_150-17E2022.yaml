abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 150-17 presents the technical requirements and guidance for
    the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
    Program (NVLAP) Cryptographic and Security Testing program. It is intended for
    information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation,
    laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing
    information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2022
    edition of NIST Handbook 150-17 introduces the new Annex H, requirements for Entropy
    Source Validation (ESV), revisions for alignment with FIPS 201-3, and other minor
    updates to existing testing programs. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150 and
    the specific requirements and interpretations in NIST Handbook 150-17 must be
    combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP Cryptographic
    and Security Testing program. For more information, visit the NVLAP website.
