abstract:
- content: Despite broad recognition that air distribution plays an important role
    in comfort for residential buildings, previous efforts to evaluate and characterize
    the performance of residential air distribution systems have largely focused on
    their impact on the heating and cooling energy consumption. However, fewer studies
    addressed the effectiveness of the tested residential air distribution systems
    to provide and maintain comfort in the conditioned space by delivering the designed
    air temperature to individual rooms throughout the house. Therefore, the purpose
    of this research is to develop an improved understanding of the impact of residential
    air distribution systems on whole-house thermal comfort and to propose analytical
    methods for evaluating this impact.
