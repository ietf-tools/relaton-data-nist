abstract:
- content: NIST s Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) division previously
    developed an access time measurement method for push-to-talk (PTT) communications
    systems. This paper introduces a correction term, called the start of word correction,
    to address a systemic error in the original measurement method. This error can
    be caused by extraneous audio prior to the start of a Modified Rhyme Test (MRT)
    keyword in the test audio clips thatwere developed for the access time measurement.
    Example measurements were performed using the start of word correction to quantify
    its affect on access time measurements.
