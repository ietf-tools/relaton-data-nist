abstract:
- content: In September 1983, the '8th U.S. - German Seminar of State and Planning
    on Environmental Specimen Banking' and the 'International Review of Environmental
    Specimen Banking' were held at the National Bureau of Standards. At these meetings
    the current status of Environmental Specimen Banking Program in the U.S., Federal
    Republic of Germany (FRG), and other countries was presented and discussed. The
    publication contains a brief summary of these meetings and separate contributions
    describing the specimen banking activities in Canada, FRG, Japan, Sweden and the
    U.S.
