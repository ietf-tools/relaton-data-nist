abstract:
- content: The safety of Automated Driving System (ADS) equipped vehicles and reliable
    methods for assessing that safety are critical for successfully deploying these
    engineered systems into the market. This document presents a novel approach for
    developing an ADS safety measurement methodology, which came from the NIST Automated
    Driving System Safety Measurement (ADSSM) Technical Working Group. The new approach
    brings together the concept of an Operating Envelope Specification (OES) a structured
    description of environmental factors or aspects that an ADS may encounter during
    operation and the NIST Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems.
