abstract:
- content: As internet technologies and cloud-based services evolve, a new market
    structure is emerging across various industries, and particularly in the data-driven-analytics-services
    industry. This could have a great impact in the smart manufacturing sector, where
    highly capable and competitive services will be vying for clients. While data
    analytics promises manufacturers new options for optimizing the capabilities of
    their systems, it also forebodes challenges integrating with existing and legacy
    systems across a variety of services and applications. To address these challenges,
    we propose a modeling framework and a set of software components for connecting
    independent cloud and third-party services to core manufacturing models. This
    document describes the framework and its components.
