abstract:
- content: The Beijing Institute of Metrology (BIM, China) and NIST have participated
    in an interlaboratory comparison, in which reference Charpy specimens of three
    energy levels were tested. Each laboratory tested 75 specimens supplied by the
    other institute, 25 per energy level, at room temperature (21 [degrees]C +/- 1
    [degree]C) and using an impact machine equipped with a 2 mm striker. The results
    obtained show good to excellent agreement between BIM and NIST, except at the
    low-energy level (20 J to 25 J), where NIST data obtained using a U type machine
    were significantly higher than BIM data obtained using a C-type machine. Twenty-five
    additional low- energy BIM specimens, tested by NIST using a C-type machine, showed
    excellent consistency with BIM reference data and therefore confirmed that, for
    low-energy specimens, the configuration of the swinging hammer may affect test
    results, due to the different stiffness/compliance of the two machine types. A
    similar, but unexpected, trend was observed for the NIST super-high-energy specimens,
    and will need to be explained though further investigations.
