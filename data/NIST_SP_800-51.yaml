abstract:
- content: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability naming scheme
    is a dictionary of common names for publicly known information technology (IT)
    system vulnerabilities. It is an emerging industry standard that has achieved
    wide acceptance by the security industry and a number of government organizations.
    Federal departments and agencies should use this standard for computer vulnerability
    related activities.
