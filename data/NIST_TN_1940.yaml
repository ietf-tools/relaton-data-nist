abstract:
- content: This work presents an investigation into second-order effects on the wind-induced
    structural dynamic behavior of high-rise steel structure, as considered within
    a Database-assisted Design (DAD) context. A geometric stiffness method that accounts
    for second-order effects and allows the dynamic analysis to be performed without
    iterations is shown to be applicable in conjunction with DAD and is used in a
    study of the response of a 60-story building, known as the CAARC building. Datasets
    of the aerodynamic pressure on the CAARC building for suburban exposure are used
    to calculate overturning moments and shear forces at the base, as well as members'
    demand-to-capacity indexes (DCIs), inter-story drift ratios, and resultant accelerations.
    Dynamic analyses are performed using five reference mean hourly wind speeds at
    the rooftop for suburban terrain exposure (Uref = 20 m/s, 40 m/s, 60 m/s, 80 m/s,
    and 100 m/s). The first three and the last three wind speeds are used in analyses
    for serviceability and strength, respectively. The second-order effects decrease
    natural frequencies of vibration of the building by up to 12 %. If the resonant
    response is not taken into account and for Uref = 80 m/s, second-order effects
    increase the non-directional peak base shears by up to 9 %, the torsional moments
    by up to 10 %, and the overturning moments by up to 15 %. If resonance is accounted
    for, (i) for Uref = 100 m/s normal to a building face, the vortex shedding frequency
    is close to the 2nd and the 3rd natural frequencies of the building, and those
    effects are increased by 40 % to 56 %; for Uref = 80 m/s and a typical set of
    21 structural members, the DCIs for the interaction of axial forces and bending
    moments, BijPM, are increased by up to 9 % for columns, 22 % for beams, and 19
    % for diagonal bracings, while the DCIs for the shear forces, BijV are increased
    by up to 33 % for columns, 14 % for beams, and 21 % for diagonal bracings; (iii)
    for Uref = 60 m/s, second-order effects [...]
