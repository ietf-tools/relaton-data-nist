abstract:
- content: 'Statistical model checking (SMC) is a formal verification method that
    combines simulations with statistical techniques to provide quantitative answers
    on whether a stochastic system satisfies some requirements with a controllable
    accuracy. SMC takes three inputs: a stochastic model, a linear-time/Metric Temporal
    Logic property to verify and a set of required confidence parameters. The stochastic
    model is generally obtained by modeling the functional behavior of a system then
    adding probabilistic variables to it, which are updated via probability distributions
    (PD). The latter is, typically, obtained by analyzing measurements from the system''s
    execution using statistical tests to select the best fit distribution. However,
    this task requires a good statistical background and familiarity with several
    distributions which is beyond the expertise of some analysts. Hence, in the case
    of SMC, assuming an incorrect distributional model for the data can lead to inappropriate
    statistical analysis as well as inaccurate verification of the system under study.
    As such, this paper presents DeepFit, a tool that uses deep learning in addition
    to traditional statistics to automate the distributional modeling process. DeepFit
    was evaluated against synthetic data and real world data and it can perform comparably
    to using maximum likelihood estimation with an Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-smirnov
    and Probability plot correlation coefficient plot goodness of fit tests.'
