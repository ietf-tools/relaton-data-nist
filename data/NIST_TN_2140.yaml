abstract:
- content: This technical report details an effort to design, demonstrate, and validate
    a test methodology to measure the impacts of Long Term Evolution (LTE) User Equipment
    (UE) emissions in the advanced wireless services 3 (AWS-3) band on aeronautical
    mobile telemetry (AMT) systems operating in the adjacent AMT band. Impacts are
    assessed by collecting and analyzing AMT system-provided key performance indicators
    (KPIs), such as bit error rate (BER). The validation process includes the capture
    and analysis for multiple adjacent band emissions (ABE) and AMT transmission combinations
    and conditions. The analysis here centers around AMT system behavior with and
    without the presence of ABE.
