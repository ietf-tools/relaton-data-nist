abstract:
- content: The uncertainty in predicting the performance of tropospheric communication
    circuits may be expressed by a variance, assuming a log-normal distribution of
    the differences between calculated and measured values of field strength or basic
    transmission loss, if a number of paths with identical geometrical and other prediction
    parameters are considered. It is shown to what extent this variance may be reduced
    by taking into account transmission loss measurements over the same path for which
    the prediction is intended, or over a similar path. The improved prediction is
    obtained by assigning weights to calculated and observed values, respectively,
    and forming a weighted average. The method is demonstrated by examples, and the
    results are used to calculate new values of service probability on the basis of
    the improved prediction. Comparison of service probabilities for predictions based
    on the cal¿̐¿ culation above, and for predictions taking into account the results
    of transmission loss measurements, enables the designer to judge whether the cost
    of a measurement program is justified in terms of possible savings in equipment
    for a final installation.
