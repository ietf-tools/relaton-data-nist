abstract:
- content: 'The Vulnerability Test Suite Generator (VTSG) Version 3 can create vast
    numbers of synthetic programs with and without specific flaws or vulnerabilities.
    Such programs are useful for measuring static analysis tools. VTSG was designed
    by the Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE) team and originally
    implemented by students at TELECOM Nancy. The latest version is structured to
    be able to generate vulnerable and nonvulnerable synthetic programs expressing
    specific flaws in typical programming languages. It has libraries to generate
    programs in PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), C#, and Python. This document may
    help if you are trying to generate test cases in PHP, C#, or Python, adding new
    complexities or flaws or vulnerability, or modifying VTSG to have new capabilities
    or to generate test cases in other programming languages.'
