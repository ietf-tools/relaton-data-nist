abstract:
- content: Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
    network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks,
    servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned
    and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This
    cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models,
    and four deployment models.
