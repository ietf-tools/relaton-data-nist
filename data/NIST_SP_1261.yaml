abstract:
- content: The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has raised concerns as
    to how to best host fall semesters at universities and colleges across the U.S.
    in the face of high transmission rates. College campuses have a communal structure
    that may allow for an infectious disease to become a serious issue to students
    and staff. College campuses are in need of resilience planning that deals with
    the presence of a pandemic. In this report, four alternatives are evaluated that
    might assist colleges in mitigating some of the negative economic effects of an
    infectious disease. The use case presented in this report is fictious and is meant
    to reflect a public four-year highereducation institution; however, the values
    used are based on real-life estimates, when available. Costs and benefits were
    configured for four alternatives and analyzed with the Economic Decision Guide
    Software (EDGe) Online Tool to determine the relative net present value of these
    resilience strategies via a benefit-cost analysis (BCA). Though designed to evaluate
    investments into built infrastructure, EDGe is demonstrated to be applicable to
    questions of resilience planning more broadly. The results of this use case show
    that an outdoor facility would be the best alternative for the college campus
    modeled, given various parameters and assumptions. The outdoor facility allows
    for the alleviation of all fatalities and has various benefits that include positive
    externalities and net co-benefits. This use case demonstrates a basic BCA using
    EDGe Online to determine a community's course of action in planning for pandemics,
    especially when some alternatives relate to built infrastructure resilience and/or
    sustainability, e.g., through indirect valuation or cobenefits.
