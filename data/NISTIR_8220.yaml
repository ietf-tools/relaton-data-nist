abstract:
- content: This document presents a performance evaluation of Long Term Evolution
    (LTE) Deviceto-device (D2D) communication when enabling frequency hopping resource
    scheduling. Moreover, as secondary objective, this document serves as a compendium
    for frequency hopping related procedures over D2D communications as defined by
    The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for the LTE standard. D2D communication
    is modeled and simulated using discrete event network simulator (ns-3). Simulated
    scenarios are designed to capture communication conditions occurring outside network
    infrastructure coverage, alike those experienced by authorized network users,
    such as public safety first responders, during network outages.
