abstract:
- content: Microservices architecture is increasingly being used to develop application
    systems since its smaller codebase facilitates faster code development, testing,
    and deployment as well as optimization of the platform based on the type of microservice,
    support for independent development teams, and the ability to scale each component
    independently. Microservices generally communicate with each other using Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs), which requires several core features to support
    complex interactions between a substantial number of components. These core features
    include authentication and access management, service discovery, secure communication
    protocols, security monitoring, availability/resiliency improvement techniques
    (e.g., circuit breakers), load balancing and throttling, integrity assurance techniques
    during induction of new services, and handling of session persistence. Additionally,
    the core features could be bundled or packaged into architectural frameworks such
    as API gateways and service mesh. The purpose of this document is to analyze the
    multiple implementation options available for each individual core feature and
    configuration options in architectural frameworks, develop security strategies
    that counter threats specific to microservices, and enhance the overall security
    profile of the microservices-based application.
