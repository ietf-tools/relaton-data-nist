abstract:
- content: Optical communication systems are expected to find use in new applications
    that require more intelligent and automated functionality. Optical networks are
    needed to address the high speeds and low latency of 5G wireless networks. The
    analog nature of optical transmission and the complexity of operation and management
    remain an impediment to greater use of software controls. The optical community
    at large has proposed many possible applications and avenues for using and implementing
    artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve functionality of optical
    systems for communications. However, broad agreement has yet to be reached due
    to both technical and non-technical reasons. On August 2nd , 2019 The National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Communications Technology Laboratory
    (CTL) hosted a Workshop on Machine Learning for Optical Communication Systems
    to bring together industry, academia and government in order to discuss the roll
    of AI and ML in optical communication systems. This document provides an overview
    and summary of the workshop.
