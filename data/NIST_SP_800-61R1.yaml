abstract:
- content: Computer security incident response has become an important component of
    information technology (IT) programs. Security-related threats have become not
    only more numerous and diverse but also more damaging and disruptive. An incident
    response capability is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss
    and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring
    computing services. This publication assists organizations in establishing computer
    security incident response capabilities and handling incidents efficiently and
    effectively. Topics covered include organizing a computer security incident response
    capability, handling incidents from initial preparation through the post-incident
    lessons learned phase, and handling specific types of incidents.
