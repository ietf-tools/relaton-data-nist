abstract:
- content: 'This document provides introductory information about firewalls and firewall
    policy. It addresses concepts relating to the design selection, deployment, and
    management of firewalls and firewall environments. It is an update to NIST Special
    Publication 10, Keeping Your Cite Comfortably Secure: An Introduction To Firewall
    Technology. This document covers IP filtering with more recently worked policy
    recommendations, and deals generally with hybrid firewalls that can filter packets
    and perform application gateway services. This document also contains specific
    recommendations for policy as well as a simple methodology for creating firewall
    policy.'
