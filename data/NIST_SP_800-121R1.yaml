abstract:
- content: Bluetooth is an open standard for short-range radio frequency communication.
    Bluetooth technology is used primarily to establish wireless personal area networks
    (WPANs), and it has been integrated into many types of business and consumer devices.
    This publication provides information on the security capabilities of Bluetooth
    technologies and gives recommendations to organizations employing Bluetooth technologies
    on securing them effectively. The Bluetooth versions within the scope of this
    publication are versions 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 + Enhanced Data Rate (EDR), 2.1 + EDR,
    3.0 + High Speed (HS), and 4.0, which includes Low Energy (LE) technology.
