abstract:
- content: Each year the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) provides a report to the
    Office of Management and Budget (OMB) summarizing federal agency use of government
    unique standards (GUS) used in lieu of voluntary consensus standards (VCS) during
    the previous fiscal year (FY) as required by Section 12(d)(3) of Public Law 104-113,
    the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA). The FY 2016
    summary, prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, compiles
    the reports provided by 25 participating agencies listed in Appendix A. In these
    reports, agencies document any new use of GUS in lieu of VCS during FY 2016 and
    provide a rationale for each new use. Agencies briefly described their activities
    undertaken to carry out provisions described in OMB Circular A-119, Federal Participation
    in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and Conformity Assessment
    Activities. Individual agency reports may be found at https://standards.gov/NTTAA/agency/index.cfm?
