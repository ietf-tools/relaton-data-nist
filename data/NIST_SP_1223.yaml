abstract:
- content: Over the past two years, the ODI has undertaken an ambitious effort to
    modernize the SRD Program. This report covers one aspect of this modernization
    effort, a comprehensive internal technical review of the 75 free data products
    currently carrying the SRD label. As part of this review, guidelines for critical
    evaluation were developed, and specific evaluation methods used by SRD researchers
    were compiled. Each of the 75 data products was analyzed for compliance with the
    guidelines and use of the methods, taking into consideration that the 2017 SRD
    Act Update stipulated data to include digital data objects. The outcome of this
    analysis was that 65% of the data products will retain the SRD label. The remaining
    35% of the data products will be assigned to other categories that better describe
    their content, including data compilations, bibliographic collections, and information
    resources. This report also includes an analysis of the latest date of new content
    for all 75 current free data products and a discussion of the implications of
    this analysis. Planning is underway for an external review of selected SRD Databases
    and other data products.
