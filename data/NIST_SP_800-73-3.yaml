abstract:
- content: FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and
    Contractors, defines procedures for the PIV lifecycle activities including identity
    proofing, registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201 also specifies
    that the identity credentials must be stored on a smart card. SP 800-73-3 contains
    the technical specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve and
    use the identity credentials. The specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability
    and PIV Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model,
    card edge interface, and application programming interface. Moreover, SP 800-73-3
    enumerates requirements where the standards include options and branches.
