abstract:
- content: The NIST Dietary Supplement Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (DSQAP)
    was established in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
    Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2007 to enable members of the dietary supplements
    community to improve the accuracy of measurements made in compliance with various
    regulations including the dietary supplement current good manufacturing practices
    (cGMPs). Exercise G of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to
    assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (Na), contaminants
    (Pb), water-soluble vitamins (folic acid), fat-soluble vitamins (beta-carotene),
    and anthocyanins in foods and/or botanical dietary supplement ingredients and
    finished products.
