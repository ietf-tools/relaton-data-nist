abstract:
- content: 'At the request of the Department of Energy''s (DOE''s) Office of Technology
    Development the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Robot Systems
    Division organized and hosted the first DOE/NIST Workshop on Common Architectures
    for Robotic Systems. The workshop had three goals: An initial review of the methodologies
    currently used by the DOE sites for development and maintenance of software related
    to robotic and remote systems; presentations by representatives of other government
    agencies on lessons learned in the development of common architectures for robotic
    and remote systems; and a preliminary assessment of the methodology necessary
    to arrive at a DOE common architecture.'
