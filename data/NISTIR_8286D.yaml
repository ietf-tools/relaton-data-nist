abstract:
- content: While business impact analysis (BIA) has historically been used to determine
    availability requirements for business continuity, the process can be extended
    to provide a broad understanding of the potential impacts of any type of loss
    on the enterprise mission. The management of enterprise risk requires a comprehensive
    understanding of mission-essential functions (i.e., what must go right) and the
    potential risk scenarios that jeopardize those functions (i.e., what might go
    wrong). The process described in this publication helps leaders determine which
    assets enable the achievement of mission objectives and evaluate the factors that
    render assets as critical and sensitive. Based on those factors, enterprise leaders
    provide risk directives (i.e., risk appetite and tolerance) as input to the BIA.
    System owners then apply the BIA to developing asset categorization, impact values,
    and requirements for the protection of critical or sensitive assets. The output
    of the BIA is the foundation for the ERM/CSRM process, as described in the NIST
    IR 8286 series, and enables consistent prioritization, response, and communication
    regarding information security risk.
