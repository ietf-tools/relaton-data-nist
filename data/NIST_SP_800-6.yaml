abstract:
- content: Computer security incidents occur with alarming frequency. The incidents
    range from direct attacks by both hackers and insiders to automated attacks such
    as network worms. Weak system controls are frequently cited as the cause, but
    many of these incidents are the result of improper use of existing control mechanisms.
    For example, improper access control specifications for key system files could
    open the entire system to unauthorized access. Moreover, many computer systems
    are delivered with default settings that, if left unchanged, leave the system
    exposed. This document discusses automated tools for testing computer system vulnerability.
    By analyzing factors affecting the security of a computer system, a system manager
    can identify common vulnerabilities stemming from administrative errors. Using
    automated tools, this process may examine the content and protections of hundreds
    of files on a multi-user system and identify subtle vulnerabilities. By acting
    on this information, system administrators can significantly reduce their systems'
    security exposure. This document examines basic requirements for vulnerability
    testing tools and describes the different functional classes of tools. Finally,
    the document offers general recommendations about the selection and distribution
    of such tools.
