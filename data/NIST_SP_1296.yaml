abstract:
- content: This report demonstrates by examples and case study as a proof of concept
    the use of loss amplification and risk aversion in benefit cost analysis (BCA)
    for community resilience planning. The report uses the NIST Economic Decision
    Guide Software (EDGe$) Online Tool, which assesses the economic feasibility of
    community resilience alternatives. Loss amplification arises from a catastrophe
    modeling method used to represent the increased costs associated with repair activity
    during a demand surge after a large catastrophe. Risk aversion is a measure of
    a community’s (or other entity’s) preference to avoid uncertainty. Risk aversion
    parameters can be used to compute certainty equivalent payoffs from uncertain
    payoffs and specific levels of risk aversion. A fictitious case study of wildfire
    disaster planning of a wildland-urban interface (WUI) is employed to demonstrate
    these two model enhancements (i.e., loss amplification and risk aversion) and
    their effects on the economic indicator outputs from EDGe$. The presented case
    study evaluates a binary development choice related to the resilience of a large
    presidential library from the perspective of two neighboring communities.
