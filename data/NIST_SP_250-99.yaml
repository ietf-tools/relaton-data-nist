abstract:
- content: 'This document, SP250-99 (2022), NIST Measurement Services: Diffuse Visual
    Transmission Density, describes the instrument used to measure diffuse visual
    transmission density of both x-ray and photographic film step tablets. These step
    tablets replace former Standard Reference Material (SRM) offerings SRM1001 and
    SRM1008. The instrument is fully automated and is designed and characterized to
    comply with the international standards for measuring transmission density using
    the diffuse influx mode. Transmission densities as great as four can be measured
    with an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of 0.006.'
