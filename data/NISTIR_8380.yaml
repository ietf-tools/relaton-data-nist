abstract:
- content: In this paper, we investigate a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network mounted
    on an airborne small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) to provide broadband connectivity
    to smartphone devices on the ground. The use case is a public safety scenario
    where users require broadband connectivity in an isolated area. We evaluate practical
    constraints for the delivery platform and the LTE system. We propose research
    questions on how the orbit of a fixed-wing sUAS would affect the coverage area
    provided by the airborne small cell, and we describe the test plan used to investigate
    our questions. We present data on multiple field experiments and provide recommendations
    for future realistic deployments.
