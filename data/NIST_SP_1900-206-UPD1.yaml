abstract:
- content: 'This publication presents research findings and scientific work that advance
    the development and progression of smart city and community measurement methodology.
    The term ''smart,'' as used in the phrase ''smart cities,'' is defined here as
    the efficient use of digital technologies to provide prioritized services and
    benefits to meet community goals. Without reliable measurement methods for ''smart,''
    there is a gap in the ability to answer questions such as ''how smart is my smart
    city plan,'' or ''how can my community strategy be made smarter?'' This report
    addresses this gap by introducing a measurement framework for assessing the direct
    and indirect benefits of smart city technologies. The Holistic KPI (H-KPI) Framework
    builds on conventional Key Performance Indicators (KPI) methods and accounts for
    unique characteristics such as varying districts and neighborhoods, differences
    in population and economic scale, the reuse of previously deployed technologies,
    and other factors relevant to a city or community. The Framework provides the
    basis for developing measuring methods and tools that allow for integration, adaptability,
    and extensibility at three interacting levels of analysis i.e. technologies, infrastructure
    services, and community benefits. The H-KPI method provides a structured representation
    of smart city/community information flows that supports system visualization,
    serves as the basis for quantitative metrics for measuring ''smart,'' and enables
    computational methods for systems design, analysis, operations, and assurance.
    The five core metrics of the method are: alignment of KPIs with community priorities
    across districts and neighborhoods; investment alignment with community priorities;
    investment efficiency; information flow density; and quality of infrastructure
    services and community benefits. Applications of the H-KPI approach include strategic
    planning, systems design and assurance, and operations management.'
