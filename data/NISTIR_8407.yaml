abstract:
- content: Automatic, Automated, or Autonomous - Unmanned Ground Vehicles (A-UGVs),
    as referred to by ASTM International Committee F45, are industrial vehicles that
    have capabilities to navigate, dock, avoid obstacles, and interact with other
    vehicles and systems all within intended environments (e.g., warehouses, hospitals,
    outdoor facility perimeters) set by the manufacturer. A new ASTM F45 standard
    is near the ballot stage to serve as a guide for providing a basis for A-UGV manufacturers
    and users to compare capabilities between A-UGVs. The guide includes a report
    for documenting that the user has proven or asserted a capability, not tested
    the capability, or that the A-UGV does not have the capability. Although an infinite
    number of A-UGV tests are possible, this paper provides three cases that test
    the new standard where one case demonstrated in a complex dual-vehicles test,
    several capabilities as written in the standard. Alternatively, two cases demonstrated
    through experiments that A-UGV capabilities as written in the standard may need
    improvements and as such, the paper provides recommendations for modifying the
    standard.
