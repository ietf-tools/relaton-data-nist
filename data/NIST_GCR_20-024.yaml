abstract:
- content: The Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing is currently constructing
    an open, standards-based flexible manufacturing cell. The manufacturing cell must
    take in a product definition, machine the defined part, inspect it, rework as
    necessary, and provide a final dimensional report. In support of this effort,
    we define a flexible architecture based entirely on open standards. In this paper
    we look at standards which support a modelbased engineering approach to conveying
    product definitions to the manufacturing cell. The STEP AP242, QIF, and JT standards
    are compared and the various considerations for their use discussed. Finally we
    define a selected standard to use and the software that will be used in order
    to implement the chosen standard mix.
