abstract:
- content: 'Standard Reference Material速 (SRM速) 2246a Relative Intensity Correction
    Standard for Raman Spectroscopy: 830 nm Excitation is intended for use in the
    correction of the relative intensity of Raman spectra obtained with Raman instruments
    employing 830 nm laser excitation. A unit of SRM 2246a consists of an optical
    glass that emits a broad-band luminescence spectrum when excited with 830 nm laser
    radiation. The shape of the mean luminescence spectrum of this glass is described
    by a mathematical expression that relates the relative spectral intensity to the
    wavenumber (cm-1) expressed as the Raman shift from the 830 nm excitation laser
    wavelength. This model, together with a measurement of the luminescence spectrum
    of the standard, can be used to determine the spectral intensity response correction
    that is unique to each Raman system. The resulting instrument intensity response
    correction may then be used to obtain Raman spectra that are largely free from
    instrument-induced spectral artifacts. This publication documents the production,
    analytical methods, and computations involved in characterizing this product.'
