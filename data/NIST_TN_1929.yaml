abstract:
- content: 'The mass loss rate of Poly(methyl methacrylate) exposed to known radiant
    fluxes is simulated with two recently-developed numerical codes, the NIST Fire
    Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and the FAA ThermaKin. The influence of various material
    properties (thickness, thermal conductivity, specific heat, absorption of infrared
    radiation, heat of reaction) on mass loss history is assessed, via their effect
    on the ignition time, average mass loss rate, peak mass loss rate, and time to
    peak. The two codes predict the influence of material parameters on the MLR in
    the order of decreasing importance: heat of reaction, thickness, specific heat,
    absorption coefficient, thermal conductivity, and activation energy of the polymer
    decomposition. Changes in the material properties also influence the MLR curves
    by switching the sample from thermally thick to thermally thin. The two numerical
    codes are generally in very good agreement for their predictions of the MLR versus
    time curves, except when in-depth absorption of radiation was important. The influence
    of two of these parameters on the effective heat of gasification (extracted from
    the mass loss rate at differing external heat fluxes) is also assessed by comparing
    the effective heat of gasification to the heat of gasification input into the
    calculations; the ratio of these is highest for calculations in which the radiant
    energy is absorbed on the surface and the material decomposition has a low activation
    energy, for which it reaches 1.3, but is lower for other cases. Modifying the
    method used to obtain the effective heat of gasification by basing it on the net
    energy delivered to the polymer brings it much closer to the values input into
    the calculation.'
