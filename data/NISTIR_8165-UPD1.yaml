abstract:
- content: The Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE) team studied
    thousands of warnings from static analyzers. Tools have difficulty distinguishing
    between the absence of a weakness and the presence of a weakness that is buried
    in otherwise-irrelevant code elements. This paper presents classes of these code
    elements, which we call “code complexities.” They have been present in software
    assurance as part of test cases generation strategy when evaluating static analyzers.
    Benefits of using code complexity include the development of coding guidelines,
    boosting diversification of test cases.
