abstract:
- content: The objective of NIST SP 800-53 is to provide a set of security controls
    that can satisfy the breadth and depth of security requirements levied on information
    systems and organizations and that is consistent with and complementary to other
    established information security standards. Revision 3 is the first major update
    since December 2005 and includes significant improvements to the security control
    catalog.
