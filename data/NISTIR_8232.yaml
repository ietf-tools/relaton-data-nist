abstract:
- content: NIST performed a large scale empirical evaluation of tattoo recognition
    algorithms. The test leveraged large operational datasets comprised of tattoo
    images from law enforcement databases, enabling evaluation with enrollment database
    sizes of up to 100,000. NIST employed a lights-out, black-box testing methodology
    designed to model operational reality where software is shipped and used as-is,
    without algorithmic training. Core tattoo identification accuracy was baselined
    over tattoo images used as-is, then traded off against gallery size and search
    speed. The effects of cropping around the primary tattoo content, skintone, contrast,
    and tattoo-to-image ratio were assessed, and matching accuracy on sketch images
    and tattoos collected in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum are also reported.
    In addition, performance on algorithmic capability to do tattoo detection and
    tattoo localization as separate tasks are also documented.
