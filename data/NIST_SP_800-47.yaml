abstract:
- content: 'The Security Guide for Interconnecting Information Technology Systems
    provides guidance for planning, establishing, maintaining, and terminating interconnections
    between information technology (IT) systems that are owned and operated by different
    organizations. They are consistent with the requirements specified in the Office
    of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, for system interconnection
    and information sharing. A system interconnection is defined as the direct connection
    of two or more IT systems for the purpose of sharing data and other information
    resources. The document describes benefits of interconnecting IT systems, defines
    the basic components of an interconnection, identifies methods and levels of interconnectivity,
    and discusses potential security risks. The document then presents a life-cycle
    approach for system interconnections, with an emphasis on security. Four phases
    are addressed: a) Planning the interconnection: the organizations perform preliminary
    activities; examine technical, security, and administrative issues; and form an
    agreement governing the management, operation, and use of the interconnection;
    b) Establishing the interconnection: the organizations develop and execute a plan
    for establishing the interconnection, including implementing or configuring security
    controls; c) Maintaining the interconnection: the organizations maintain the interconnection
    after it is established to ensure that it operates properly and securely; and
    d) Disconnecting the interconnection: one or both organizations may terminate
    the interconnection. The termination should be conducted in a planned manner to
    avoid disrupting the other party''s system. In an emergency, however, one or both
    organizations may choose to terminate the interconnection immediately. The document
    provides recommended steps for completing each phase, emphasizing security measures
    to protect the systems and shared data. The document also contains guides and
    samples for developing an Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) and a Memorandum
    of Understanding/Agreement (MOU/A). The ISA specifies technical and security requirements
    of the interconnection; the MOU/A defines the responsibilities of the organizations.
    Finally, the document contains a guide for developing an Implementation Plan to
    establish the interconnection.'
