abstract:
- content: The preservation of digital evidence (DE) presents unique problems beyond
    traditional evidence preservation. This document addresses considerations related
    to the preservation of digital evidence. This document is part of a series on
    evidence management and its primary audience is evidence management professionals.
    The document discusses traditional sources of digital evidence including physical
    storage media and digital objects and also addresses law enforcement generated
    digital evidence. The document further discusses key considerations related to
    digital evidence preservation and the difference from the preservation of other
    evidence types. Related considerations, such as acquisition of digital evidence
    are only addressed when there is overlap with preservation.
