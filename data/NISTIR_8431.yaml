abstract:
- content: This report summarizes the feedback received on the work of the NIST Cybersecurity
    for the Internet of Things (IoT) program on IoT product cybersecurity criteria
    at a virtual workshop in June 2022. The purpose of this workshop was to obtain
    feedback on specific considerations and techniques for addressing those considerations
    around cybersecurity in IoT products. These considerations have broad applicability
    across IoT product sectors, including the consumer IoT products sector and the
    industrial IoT sector. For consumer IoT, these considerations arose in moving
    the criteria presented in Recommended Criteria for Cybersecurity Labeling for
    Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) Products into draft NIST IR 8425, Profile of
    the IoT Core Baseline for Consumer IoT Products, along with a discussion paper
    on the complexity of risk identification for IoT published before the workshop.
