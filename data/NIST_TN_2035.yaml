abstract:
- content: 'Externally-launched computer worms which maliciously propagate within
    networks are one of the most serious and dangerous security threats facing the
    commercial, political, military, and research community today. With an eye to
    the ultimate goal of detection and prevention of such worms, this paper addresses
    the preliminary step of constructing a predictive model for worm propagation.
    For this model we have chosen 3 fundamental factors known to affect worm propagation:
    size of the network IP space, proportion of the IP space with susceptible hosts,
    and rate at which an infected host scans other vulnerable hosts. This paper presents
    in detail the methodology (simulator construction + data generation + 2 sequential
    fitting steps) for constructing similar such general models; this methodology
    will have application across a variety f worm modeling scenarios. For demonstration
    purposes (and with no loss of generality), we apply this methodology to a 3-factor
    Class B network and derive a high quality (error < 4%) predictive model across
    the 3 factors and across the entire iterative life of the worm. Further for this
    example, this paper presents a worm propagation sensitivity analysis which provides
    valuable insight into the most important factors and interactions affecting worm
    propagation speed.'
