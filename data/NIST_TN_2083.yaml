abstract:
- content: A series of measurements were made to investigate the thermal character
    of a 1 m diameter methyl alcohol (methanol; CH3OH) pool fire steadily burning
    with a constant lip height in a quiescent environment. The mass burning rate was
    measured by monitoring the mass loss in the methanol reservoir feeding the liquid
    pool. The heat release rate was measured using oxygen consumption calorimetry.
    Time-averaged local measurements of gas-phase temperature were conducted using
    50 Âèym diameter, Type S, bare wires, with a bead that was approximately spherical
    with a diameter of about 150 Âèym. The thermocouple signals were corrected for
    radiative loss and thermal inertia effects. The heat flux was measured in the
    radial and vertical directions and the radiative fraction was determined. The
    average steady-state mass burning rate was measured as 12.8 g/s ± 0.2 g/s, which
    yields an idealized heat release rate of 254 kW ± 7 kW. The measured heat release
    rate was 256 kW ± 20 kW, which was consistent with the mass burning rate measurement.
    The maximum corrected mean and RMS temperature measured in the fire was 1371 K
    ± 247, which occurred on the centerline, 30 cm above the burner rim. The results
    showed that the radiative fraction was 0.22 ± 45% consistent with previous results.
