abstract:
- content: Cyber threat information is any information that can help an organization
    identify, assess, monitor, and respond to cyber threats. Cyber threat information
    includes indicators of compromise; tactics, techniques, and procedures used by
    threat actors; suggested actions to detect, contain, or prevent attacks; and the
    findings from the analyses of incidents. Organizations that share cyber threat
    information can improve their own security postures as well as those of other
    organizations. This publication provides guidelines for establishing and participating
    in cyber threat information sharing relationships. This guidance helps organizations
    establish information sharing goals, identify cyber threat information sources,
    scope information sharing activities, develop rules that control the publication
    and distribution of threat information, engage with existing sharing communities,
    and make effective use of threat information in support of the organizations overall
    cybersecurity practices.
