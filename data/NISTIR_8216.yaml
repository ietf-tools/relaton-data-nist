abstract:
- content: 'The public safety community is in the process of transitioning from the
    use of land mobile radios to a technology ecosystem including a variety of broadband
    data sharing platforms. Successful deployment and adoption of new communication
    technology relies on efficient and effective user interfaces based on a clear
    understanding of first responder needs, requirements and contexts of use. The
    project employs a two-phased data collection approach for an in-depth look at
    the population of first responders, along with their work environment, their tasks,
    and their communication needs. This report documents the data collection of Phase
    1 and the first iteration of data analysis. Phase 1, the qualitative component,
    focuses on interviews with approximately 240 first responders (law enforcement,
    fire fighters, emergency medical services, communications/dispatch) across the
    country. Results include: approximately 90 user needs and requirements expressed
    by first responders; five categories of technology opportunities; six principles
    for technology development; and the role of trust in usage of communication technology.'
