abstract:
- content: This paper explores a low-cost method to bridge analog public safety Land
    mobile radio (LMR) systems into a standards based Long Term Evolution (LTE) MCPTT
    system. Design goals included robustness, cost, and the creation of a system that
    closely conforms to released and future standards. A proof of concept prototype
    that successfully bridges an analog LMR system with a standards compliant LTE
    based MCPTT system was developed and tested. The results and design details will
    be covered in this paper.
