abstract:
- content: By taking corrective action for electrical noise deriving from thermal
    agitation, alternating current pickup, and induced electrostatic charges, it has
    been possible to use a commercially available high gain d. c. amplifier and a
    recorder to balance a G-3 Mueller Bridge. Noise levels below 0. 01 microvolt peak
    to peak were observed with a response time of approximately five seconds. A precision
    of approximately two microhms was obtained in measuring a ten ohm resistor in
    a short series of measurements.
