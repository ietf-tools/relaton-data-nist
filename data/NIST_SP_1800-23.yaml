abstract:
- content: 'Industrial control systems (ICS) compose a core part of our nation''s
    critical infrastructure. Energy sector companies rely on ICS to generate, transmit,
    and distribute power and to drill, produce, refine, and transport oil and natural
    gas. Given the wide variety of ICS assets, such as programmable logic controllers
    and intelligent electronic devices, that provide command and control information
    on operational technology (OT) networks, it is essential to protect these devices
    to maintain continuity of operations. These assets must be monitored and managed
    to reduce the risk of a cyber attack on ICS-networked environments. Having an
    accurate OT asset inventory is a critical component of an overall cybersecurity
    strategy. NIST SP 1800-23B: Energy Sector Asset Management iii The NCCoE at NIST
    is responding to the energy sector''s request for an automated OT asset management
    solution. To remain fully operational, energy sector entities should be able to
    effectively identify, control, and monitor their OT assets. This document provides
    guidance on how to enhance OT asset management practices by leveraging capabilities
    that may already exist in an energy organization''s operating environment as well
    as implementing new capabilities.'
