abstract:
- content: 'This report presents the concept of the resilience dividend as a useful
    metric for community resilience planning. The report suggests defining the resilience
    dividend as the net co-benefit (or co-cost) of investing in enhanced resilience,
    in the absence of a disruptive incident. In order for this definition to be useful,
    the report reviews literature on co-benefits. The main lessons from this review
    are that: (1) there is no consensus on the use of the meaning of co-benefit; (2)
    much of the literature on co-benefits is focused on climate change; and (3) there
    exist opportunities for the development of co-benefit measurement and assessment
    methodologies in the context of resilience planning. This report provides guidance
    and direction on the study and use of the resilience dividend by categorizing
    the various definitions of co-benefits to provide a frame of reference, reviewing
    measurement and assessment efforts, and summarizing the review in an annotated
    bibliography that can serve as a quick guide for researchers and practitioners
    looking for existing work on co-benefits. The report also highlights potential
    directions for future research.'
