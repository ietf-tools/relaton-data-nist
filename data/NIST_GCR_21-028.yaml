abstract:
- content: U.S. copyright laws do not allow government-owned government-operated (GOGO)
    laboratories of Federal agencies to obtain copyright protection for the software
    products they develop. This report provides an assessment of the likely economic
    effects of allowing copyright protection for software products created in the
    GOGO laboratories. The report uses a formal survey of Federal agencies GOGO laboratories
    and government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) laboratories to describe their
    software development and licensing activities over the past five years and to
    make forecasts about the effects of eliminating the copyright prohibition. The
    survey responses indicate that if copyrights for government-created software are
    allowed, the availability of the software for use by others will increase dramatically.
    Forecasts of the economic impacts of the expected increase in the available software
    are made using estimated models of licensing revenues and licensing costs for
    the survey respondents. The forecasts for the respondents are extrapolated to
    their parent Federal agencies and then to all Federal agencies. Information about
    the economy-wide impact for the software industry is combined with the information
    about the software activities of the Federal agencies to project economy-wide
    benefits of lifting the restrictions on copyrighting software developed by GOGO
    laboratories. Changing the copyright law to allow copyright protection for GOGO
    software is expected to have a positive economic impact on the U.S. economy because
    the software made available will increase the productivity of its users. This
    report provides a first look at software activity that has not previously been
    systematically tracked and reported.
