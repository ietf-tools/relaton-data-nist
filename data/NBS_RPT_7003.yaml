abstract:
- content: Resistance strain gages of the S-700 series, manufactured by the Instruments
    Division of the Budd Company (formerly the Tatnall Measuring Systems Company)
    were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The characteristics determined were (1)
    gage factor at room temperature, (2) variation of gage factor with increasing
    temperature, (3) drift, (4) resistance-temperature relationship, (5) behavior
    when subjected to large strains and (6) behavior under transient heating conditions¿̐¿
    The results of these tests indicate that, when attached to stainless steel, the
    use of these gages may be limited by the effect of gage history on the gage factor;
    the high drift rate at about 800¿̐¿ F; the high temperature coefficient of resistance,
    especially at about 1000¿̐¿ F; and the difficulty in maintaining a good bond to
    stainless steel at 1500¿̐¿ F.
