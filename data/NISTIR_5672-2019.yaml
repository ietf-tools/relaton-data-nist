abstract:
- content: This publication provides guidelines for evaluating data from advanced
    mass calibrations and for establishing measurement assurance programs in precision
    mass calibration laboratories. The NIST Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) uses
    these guidelines when evaluating advanced mass calibration data for State laboratories
    that request technical support, recognition, and/or NVLAP accreditation.
