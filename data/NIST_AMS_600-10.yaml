abstract:
- content: Over the past decade, a consistent theme in enhancing U.S. global competitiveness
    has been the need for U.S. leadership in critical advanced manufacturing technologies.
    Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D Printing, has been among those critical
    technologies. Recently, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee
    on Advanced Manufacturing (SAM) and Subcommittee on the Materials Genome Initiative
    (SMGI) jointly formed an interagency team to analyze the slow adoption of AM for
    high-consequence applications. The interagency team developed this report to define
    the problems limiting implementation of AM, with a focus on identifying the specific
    issues limiting wider adoption of AM for high-consequence parts, and the R&D gaps
    that need to be addressed to reduce the risk and cost of adoption of AM by increasing
    confidence in AM processes and parts used in high-consequence applications. The
    sections that follow define the specific issues holding back AM technology and
    provide the context of the problem. This leads to recommendations to guide future
    efforts in technology development to ensure increased adoption of high-consequence
    AM and U.S. leadership in the field.
