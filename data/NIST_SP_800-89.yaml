abstract:
- content: 'Entities participating in the generation or verification of digital signatures
    depend on the authenticity of the process. This Recommendation specifies methods
    for obtaining the assurances necessary for valid digital signatures: assurance
    of domain parameter validity, assurance of public key validity, assurance that
    the key pair owner actually possesses the private key, and assurance of the identity
    of the key pair owner.'
