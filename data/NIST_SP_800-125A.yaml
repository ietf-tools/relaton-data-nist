abstract:
- content: The Hypervisor is a collection of software modules that provides virtualization
    of hardware resources (such as CPU/GPU, Memory, Network and Storage) and thus
    enables multiple computing stacks (basically made of an OS and Application programs)
    called Virtual Machines (VMs) to be run on a single physical host. In addition,
    it may have the functionality to define a network within the single physical host
    (called virtual network) to enable communication among the VMs resident on that
    host as well as with physical and virtual machines outside the host. With all
    this functionality, the hypervisor has the responsibility to mediate access to
    physical resources, provide run time isolation among resident VMs and enable a
    virtual network that provides security-preserving communication flow among the
    VMs and between the VMs and the external network. The architecture of a hypervisor
    can be classified in different ways. The security recommendations in this document
    relate to ensuring the secure execution of baseline functions of the hypervisor
    and are therefore agnostic to the hypervisor architecture. Further, the recommendations
    are in the context of a hypervisor deployed for server virtualization and not
    for other use cases such as embedded systems and desktops. Recommendations for
    secure configuration of virtual network are dealt with in a separate NIST document
    (SP 800-125B).
