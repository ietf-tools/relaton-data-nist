abstract:
- content: 'Computer security assurance provides a basis for one to have confidence
    that security measures, both technical and operational, work as intended. Use
    of products with an appropriate degree of assurance contributes to security and
    assurance of the system as a whole and thus should be an important factor in IT
    procurement decisions. Two Government programs are of particular interest: the
    National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP)''s Common Criteria Evaluation
    and Validation Program and NIST''s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).
    The NIAP program focuses on evaluations of products (e.g., a firewall or operating
    system) against a set of security specifications. The CMVP program focuses on
    security conformance testing of a cryptographic module against Federal Information
    Processing Standard 140-1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules and
    related federal cryptographic algorithm standards.'
