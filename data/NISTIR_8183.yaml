abstract:
- content: This document provides the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) implementation
    details developed for the manufacturing environment. The Manufacturing Profile
    of the Cybersecurity Framework can be used as a roadmap for reducing cybersecurity
    risk for manufacturers that is aligned with manufacturing sector goals and industry
    best practices. This Manufacturing Profile provides a voluntary, risk-based approach
    for managing cybersecurity activities and reducing cyber risk to manufacturing
    systems. The Manufacturing Profile is meant to enhance but not replace current
    cybersecurity standards and industry guidelines that the manufacturer is embracing.
