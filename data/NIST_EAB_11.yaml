abstract:
- content: This economic analysis brief summarizes the efforts and results of the
    data collection and analysis of NIST's calibration customer information. Summary
    statistics for calibration customers are provided for fiscal years 2010 through
    2015. Included in the analysis are demographically descriptive variables such
    as the age, location, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes,
    number of employees and geographic distribution of NIST calibration customers.
    Overall, these features provide an understanding of the demographic characteristics
    of entities that purchase calibration services from NIST.
