abstract:
- content: While contactless fingerprint capture devices stand to provide for many
    benefits, images from this nascent technology are sufficiently different than
    traditional contact-collected images thereby warranting the separation of these
    new contactless fingerprint images from legacy contact-collected images and systems
    operating on them. This Best Practices Recommendation defines voluntary (informative)
    changes to the ANSI/NIST standard to allow for the creation of contactless transactions
    that are not readily ingestible by existing systems, but based closely on ANSI/NIST
    so that minimal changes to the system can allow for processing. Furthermore, the
    transactions can include the original sensor data, in addition to the contact-compatible/interoperable
    image in the event that vendors improve their technologies and allow for the reprocessing
    of the data without recapturing.
