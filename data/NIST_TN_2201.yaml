abstract:
- content: Laser-assisted atom probe tomography (L-APT) was used to measure the indium
    mole fraction x of c-plane, MOCVD-grown, GaN/InxGa1-xN/GaN test structures and
    the results were compared with Rutherford backscattering analysis (RBS). Four
    separate sample types were examined with x = 0.030, 0.034, 0.056, and 0.11 as
    determined by RBS. The respective InxGa1-xN layer thicknesses were 330 nm, 327
    nm, 360 nm, and 55 nm. L-APT data were collected under (fixed) laser pulse energy
    (PE)conditions in the range of (2 1000) fJ. Sample temperatures were generally
    54 K. The data were analyzed using different region-of-interest (ROI) volumes
    to establish criteria for both data collection and compositional analysis that
    would return L-APT results that fell within the estimated 0.5 at. % uncertainty
    of RBS. Using cylindrical ROIs placed coaxially within the reconstructed InxGa1-xN
    regions, and with ROI depths of (55 180) nm, PE values in the range of(2 100)
    fJ yielded indium concentrations that conformed to RBS. L-APT results were comparatively
    insensitive to ROI diameter such that 20-nm-diameter coaxial ROIs yielded indium
    concentrations nearly equal to ROIs that encompassed the full InxGa1-xN regions.
    By contrast, for the GaN portions of the samples, L-APT would only yield near-stochiometric
    composition for PE in the range of (5 20) fJ with the analysis restricted to coaxial
    ROIs of diameters ?20 nm. m-plane oriented L-APT specimens were derived from core-shell
    GaN/InxGa1-xN multi-quantum-well structures. Analysis within ROIs placed along
    [0001] of these m-plane samples revealed a spatial asymmetry in charge-state ratios
    that is consistent with an electrostatic effect arising from spontaneous polarization.
    Both c-plane and m-plane sample types showed depth-dependent variations in absolute
    ion counts that depended upon ROI placement.
