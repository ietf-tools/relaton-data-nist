abstract:
- content: This report presents an approach to verifying executability of system behavior
    models by treating them as logical constraint problems solved using Satisfiability
    Modulo Theory (SMT). With behavior models interpreted as logical constraints on
    execution order, these solvers can determine whether the models are executable
    by finding executions that meet those constraints, or not executable because they
    are overconstrained. The approach relies on Ontological Behavior Modeling (OBM)
    to unify behavior modeling in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) under a logical
    framework based on its structural elements. Translation patterns are proposed
    between SysML structural models, OBM, and logical constructs in SMT-LIB, a language
    used as input to SMT solvers. Software developed based on these patterns automatically
    translates SysML models extended with OBM into SMT-LIB files. Finally, the approach
    and software are demonstrated by translating and solving example SysML behavior
    models.
