abstract:
- content: The purpose of NIST Special Publication 800-53A is to provide guidelines
    for building effective security assessment plans and procedures to enable the
    assessment of security controls employed in information systems supporting the
    executive agencies of the federal government. Organizations should use this publication
    in conjunction with an approved system security plan to create a viable security
    assessment plan for producing and compiling the information necessary to determine
    the effectiveness of the security controls employed within the information system.
    The assessment procedures should be used as a starting point for and as input
    to the security assessment. SP800-53A guidelines are applicable to all federal
    information systems other than those systems designated as national security systems
    as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542. The guidelines have been broadly developed
    from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for national security
    systems. This publication is intended to serve a diverse group of information
    system and information security professionals, including individuals with information
    system and security management and oversight responsibilities, integration responsibilities,
    operational responsibilities, and security assessment and monitoring responsibilities.
