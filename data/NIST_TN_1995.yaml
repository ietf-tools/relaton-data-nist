abstract:
- content: The Juliet test suite is a systematic set of thousands of small test programs
    in C/C++ and Java exhibiting over 100 classes of errors, such as buffer overflow,
    OS injection, hardcoded password, absolute path traversal, NULL pointer dereference,
    uncaught exception, deadlock, and missing release of resource. These test programs
    should be helpful in determining capabilities of software assurance tools, particularly
    static analyzers, in Unix, Microsoft Windows, and other environments. Juliet was
    developed by the National Security Agency's Center for Assured Software and first
    released in December 2010. It has been enhanced twice since then. Version 1.2
    was released in May 2013 with a total of 86,864 test cases. Released in October
    2017, version 1.3 fixes about two dozen systematic problems in version 1.2 and
    adds tests for pre- and postincrement and -decrement operators. This technical
    note details the changes from version 1.2 to 1.3. This note also lists the systematic
    problems that we know remain in Juliet 1.3.
