abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 130 includes a compilation of model laws and regulations
    and related interpretations and guidelines designed to encourage uniformity in
    adoption and implementation of weights and measures laws and regulations. The
    model laws and regulations included in NIST Handbook 130 are adopted in various
    forms by many state, local, and some federal weights and measures authorities.
    Some authorities adopt the current versions as written; some use them as the basis
    of adoption, but from an earlier year; some use them as a guideline only; some
    elect to use their own laws or regulations; and some have no corresponding law
    or regulation in place. This 2024 edition includes amendments made through the
    Committee on Laws and Regulations of the NCWM with technical guidance from the
    Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) of the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) and input from weights and measures officials and industry representatives.
    These amendments were adopted by the NCWM at its 108th Annual Meeting in July
    2023.
