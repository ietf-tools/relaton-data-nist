abstract:
- content: 'The increasing trend in building microservices-based applications calls
    for addressing security in all aspects of service-to-service interactions due
    to their unique characteristics. The distributed cross-domain nature of microservices
    needs secure token service (STS), key management and encryption services for authentication
    and authorization, and secure communication protocols. The ephemeral nature of
    clustered containers (by which microservices are implemented) calls for secure
    service discovery. The availability requirement calls for: (a) resiliency techniques,
    such as load balancing, circuit breaking, and throttling, and (b) continuous monitoring
    (for the health of the service). The service mesh is the best-known approach that
    can facilitate specification of these requirements at a level of abstraction such
    that it can be uniformly and consistently defined while also being effectively
    implemented without making changes to individual microservice code. The purpose
    of this document is to provide deployment guidance for proxy-based Service Mesh
    components that collectively form a robust security infrastructure for supporting
    microservices-based applications.'
