abstract:
- content: 'This report describes work that measured the three dimensional emission
    patterns for a variety of user equipment (UE) handset devices operating on long-term
    evolution (LTE) protocols. This effort was part of a National Advanced Spectrum
    and Communication Test Network (NASCTN) project sponsored by the Defense Spectrum
    Organization (DSO) to investigate the factors that influence aggregate LTE UE
    emissions in the advanced wireless service 3 (AWS-3) band and the sensitivity
    of the emissions to those factors. The work presented in this technical note supported
    the NASCTN''s ''Aggregate LTE: Characterizing UE Emissions'' project outcomes
    by ensuring the best orientation and associated uncertainty for transmission was
    known for each UE tested. Due to the potential benefit to the broader spectrum
    community, this work is being released as a stand-along technical report as well
    as an appendix to the final ''Aggregate LTE: Characterizing UE Emissions'' technical
    report'
