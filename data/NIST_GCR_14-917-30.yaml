abstract:
- content: 'The objective of this project was to study and make recommendations concerning
    the utilization of high-strength steel reinforcing bars in concrete structures
    subjected to earthquake ground motion. This work grew out of the ATC-57 report,
    The Missing Piece: Improving Seismic Design and Construction Practices (ATC, 2003),
    which defines a roadmap for the NIST problem-focused research and development
    program in earthquake engineering. The ATC-57 report recommended that NIST examine
    new technologies that can improve construction productivity, such as high-strength
    reinforcement.'
