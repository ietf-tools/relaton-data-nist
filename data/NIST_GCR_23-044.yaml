abstract:
- content: The purpose of this impact assessment is to provide stakeholders with relevant
    information about how the PSCR program spent Public Safety Trust Funds and the
    results of that funding. This report seeks to demonstrate the value and positive
    outcomes of a one-time injection of funds into a topic area and the extent to
    which this model can be repeated in other areas of significant impact, such as
    semiconductor research and manufacturing programs or incentivizing research in
    the cause and effects of climate change.
