abstract:
- content: NIST certifies a suite of Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) to be used
    to evaluate specific aspects of the instrument performance and measurements via
    the powder diffraction technique. This includes machines that utilize X-rays,
    both synchrotron and laboratory-based sources, and neutron powder diffractometers.
    This report describes the preparation and certification of SRM 640g, the eighth
    generation of this powder diffraction SRM, which is designed to be used primarily
    for calibrating powder diffractometers with respect to line position. A unit consists
    of approximately 7.5 g of silicon powder prepared from intrinsic, float-zone boules.
    The boules were crushed and ultimately jet milled to a narrow particle size distribution
    centered on 4 micrometers, and with none smaller than 2.5 micrometers. The powder
    was then annealed at a temperature and time sufficient to eliminate crystallographic
    defects. Given that the lower particle size limit and the annealing process precluded
    sample induced line profile broadening, the SRM can also be used for the determination
    of the instrument profile function on equipment utilizing laboratory X-ray sources.
    It can also be used for evaluation of high-resolution equipment; however, advanced
    data analysis strategies must be employed. The SRM is certified with respect to
    the lattice parameter, with the SI traceability of the measurements being through
    the Cu Kα emission spectrum of the X-ray source that was used. A NIST-built diffractometer,
    incorporating many advanced design features, was used to provide data for the
    certification of the lattice parameter. Both statistical and systematic uncertainties
    have been assigned to yield a certified value for the lattice parameter at 22.5
    °C of a = 0.5431144 nm with an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) interval of ± 0.000008
    nm. Prior to comminution, the lattice parameter of single-crystal silicon specimens
    cut from the boules was measured using the NIST lattice comparator. A value of
    0.543102055 nm ± 0.000000027 nm was obtained.
