abstract:
- content: 'This document gives recommendations and guidelines for enhancing trust
    in email. The primary audience includes enterprise email administrators, information
    security specialists and network managers. This guideline applies to federal IT
    systems and will also be useful for small or medium sized organizations. Technologies
    recommended in support of core Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and the Domain
    Name System (DNS) include mechanisms for authenticating a sending domain: Sender
    Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain based Message
    Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). Recommendations for email transmission
    security include Transport Layer Security (TLS) and associated certificate authentication
    protocols. Recommendations for email content security include the encryption and
    authentication of message content using S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
    Extensions) and associated certificate and key distribution protocols.'
