abstract:
- content: Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are software or hardware systems that
    automate the process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or
    network, analyzing them for signs of security problems. As network attacks have
    increased in number and severity over the past few years, intrusion detection
    systems have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of most
    organizations. This guidance document is intended as a primer in intrusion detection
    , developed for those who need to understand what security goals intrusion detection
    mechanisms serve, how to select and configure intrusion detection systems for
    their specific system and network environments, how to manage the output of intrusion
    detection systems, and how integrate intrusion detection functions with the rest
    of the organizational security infrastructure.
