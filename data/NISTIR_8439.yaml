abstract:
- content: This report documents the ability of face recognition algorithms to correctly
    distinguish face images of identical and fraternal twins. The algorithms were
    submitted to the ongoing one-to-one verifcation track of the Face Recognition
    Vendor Test (FRVT) executed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST).
