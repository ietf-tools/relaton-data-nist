abstract:
- content: Safe evacuation during a fire or other catastrophic event is crucial for
    the safety of the buildings occupants. Since the tragic loss of life in the World
    Trade Center disaster, efforts have refocused on the provision of safe and efficient
    evacuation procedures, especially for occupants who cannot negotiate exit stairs
    without assistance. Several evacuation options have been designed specifically
    for people with mobility impairments, including occupant evacuation elevators
    (OEEs). The purpose of this report is to provide guidance to assist designers,
    facility managers, and fire emergency personnel on how they might improve designs,
    technologies, and emergency procedures for safer evacuation of occupants with
    mobility impairments during fire emergencies.
