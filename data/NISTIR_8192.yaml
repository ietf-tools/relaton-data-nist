abstract:
- content: This proceedings documents the July 11-12, 2017 Enhancing Resilience of
    the Internet and Communications Ecosystem workshop led by National Institute of
    Standards and Technology Standards. Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity
    of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure required the Secretaries of Commerce
    and Homeland Security to jointly lead an open and transparent process to identify
    and promote action by appropriate stakeholders to improve the resilience of the
    internet and communications ecosystem and to encourage collaboration with the
    goal of dramatically reducing threats perpetrated by automated and distributed
    attacks (e.g., botnets). The workshop was designed to allow stakeholders to explore
    a range of current and emerging solutions to enhance the resilience of the Internet
    and communications ecosystem (the ecosystem) against automated, distributed threats
    in an open and transparent manner. The workshop attracted 150 participants from
    diverse stakeholder communities and was conducted under Chatham House Rules.
