abstract:
- content: This report provides general recommendations for collecting, curating,
    and re-using manufacturing data from both additive and subtractive processes.
    The intended audience includes researchers, technical-assessment personnel, and
    end-users who would like to collect data from manufacturing equipment on the shop
    floor. These recommendations provide guidance to design and implement a network-based
    solution to manage data collected from manufacturing equipment on the shop floor.
    To the extent possible, broadly-accepted, international, open, consensus-based
    standards are recommended. Using this report, the reader should be able to understand
    the value of collecting manufacturing data, how to get started collect it, and
    the relevant manufacturing data standards that may help in this process.
