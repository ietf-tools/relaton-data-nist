abstract:
- content: A new Standard Reference Material (SRM) for portland cement clinker has
    been produced for the Office of Standard Reference Materials at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST). The SRM clinkers are intended for use in developing
    and testing quantitative methods of phase analysis for portland cement and cement
    clinker. The new SRM is one of three clinkers available representing the range
    of grain sizes and compositions of North American clinker production. SRM 2686b
    is a medium-grained, heterogeneous phase distribution clinker similar in phase
    composition and grain size to the original SRM 2686. Certification of phase abundance
    was accomplished using quantitative x-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron
    microscopy with image analyses. These methods provide mutually unique means to
    establish phase abundance, which subsequently are combined to establish certified
    values and uncertainties. This clinker differs from the earlier SRMs by the presence
    of ?-C2S. Since SEM imaging does not distinguish between the ? and ? polymorphs
    of C2S, a certified value representing the combined mass fraction is provided
    and informational values are provided for the individual polymorph fractions.
    For alkali sulfates and free lime, phase abundance is established using a single
    method (XRD) so only informational values are provided. While the XRD data are
    close to that of microscopy, some distinct differences are seen. The disagreements
    may reflect the difficulty in resolving the fine-grained aluminate and ferrite
    interstitial phases using the microscope and challenges in decomposing highly
    overlapped powder diffraction data. The XRD data do display greater precision
    than replicate measurements by microscopy, likely the result of the specimen homogenization
    resulting from grinding the clinker to a powder. The certified reference values
    are consensus values, calculated by combining the results from both measurement
    techniques using the DerSimonian-Laird method with the standard uncertainties
    based upon the Horn-Horn-Duncan variance estimate. Reference values are best estimates
    based upon a single measurement technique. Reference values are provided for phases
    periclase, arcanite, aphthitalite, and lime from only the XRD data.
