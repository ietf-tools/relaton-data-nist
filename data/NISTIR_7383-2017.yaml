abstract:
- content: This publication contains Good Measurement Procedures (GMP), Good Laboratory
    Procedures (GLP), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for use in calibration
    laboratories performing volumetric calibrations. This edition is updated from
    the 2013 version with minor updates to SOPs 14, 18, 19, 26 to explicitly calculate
    and report the mean volume and enter values from Run 1 and Run 2 into standard
    deviation charts; SOP 21 (revised March 2017) to remove the neck calibration procedure
    and refine the measurement process. The SOP 21 revision also includes calculations
    and corrections for the volume at 60 [degrees] F and 100 psig in one step instead
    of two and to explicitly calculate and report the mean volume and enter values
    from Run 1 and Run 2 into standard deviation charts. SOP 31 is a new procedure
    used for neck calibrations of provers and test measures.
