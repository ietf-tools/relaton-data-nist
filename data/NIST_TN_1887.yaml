abstract:
- content: This manual describes the computer program CONTAM version 3.2, developed
    by NIST. CONTAM is a multizone indoor air quality and ventilation analysis program
    designed to help determine airflows, contaminant concentrations, and personal
    exposure in buildings. Airflows include infiltration, exfiltration, and room-to-room
    airflow rates and pressure differences in building systems, and can be driven
    by mechanical means, wind pressures acting on the exterior of the building, and
    buoyancy effects induced by temperature differences between zones, including the
    outdoors. Contaminant concentrations include the transport and fate of airborne
    contaminants, due to airflow, chemical and radio-chemical transformation, adsorption
    and desorption to building materials, filtration, and deposition to and resuspension
    from building surfaces. Personal exposure includes the exposure of building occupants
    to airborne contaminants, for eventual risk assessment.
