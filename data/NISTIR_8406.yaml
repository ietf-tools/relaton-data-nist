abstract:
- content: This document is the Cybersecurity Framework Profile developed for the
    Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) industry and the subsidiary functions that support
    the overarching liquefaction process, transport, and distribution of LNG. The
    LNG Cybersecurity Framework Profile can be used by liquefaction facilities, LNG
    vessels, and other supporting entities of the LNG lifecycle so that cybersecurity
    risks associated with these critical processes and systems can be minimized. The
    LNG Profile provides a voluntary, risk-based approach for managing cybersecurity
    activities and reducing cyber risk to the overall LNG process. The Cybersecurity
    Framework LNG Profile is meant to supplement but not replace current cybersecurity
    standards, regulations, and industry guidelines that are already being used by
    the Liquefied Natural Gas industry.
