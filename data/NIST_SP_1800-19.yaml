abstract:
- content: A cloud workload is an abstraction of the actual instance of a functional
    application that is virtualized or containerized to include compute, storage,
    and network resources. Organizations need to be able to monitor, track, apply,
    and enforce their security and privacy policies on their cloud workloads, based
    on business requirements, in a consistent, repeatable, and automated way. The
    goal of this project is to develop a trusted cloud solution that will demonstrate
    how trusted compute pools leveraging hardware roots of trust can provide the necessary
    security capabilities. These capabilities not only provide assurance that cloud
    workloads are running on trusted hardware and in a trusted geolocation or logical
    boundary, but also improve the protections for the data in the workloads and in
    the data flows between workloads. The example solution leverages modern commercial
    off-the-shelf technology and cloud services to address lifting and shifting a
    typical multi-tier application between an organization-controlled private cloud
    and a hybrid/public cloud over the internet.
