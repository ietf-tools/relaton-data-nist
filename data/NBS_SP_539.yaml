abstract:
- content: A regional seminar sponsored by the Korea Standards Research Institute,
    the National Bureau of Standards, and the U.S. Agency for International Development
    was held at the new K-SRI Laboratories at Daeduk near Dae Jeon in the Republic
    of Korea on September 27-28, 1978. The participants representing most of the countries
    in the South Asian and Western Pacific Region discussed the importance of providing
    services in measurement science and technology (metrology) to governmental and
    industrial organizations in the region. The consensus was that a need for a central
    national capability in metrology existed in countries at all levels of development,
    and that that central organization could be a focal point for intra- and international
    cooperation, which alone could lead to compatibility of measurements, a prerequisite
    for quality control for all kinds of products in domestic and international markets.
    Australia and New Zealand had established a group of accredited test laboratories
    to disseminate the accuracies inherent in the national measurement system. Industry
    was increasingly aware that metrology was essential to development, but the specific
    needs at appropriate accuracies needed to be established by surveys. The Korean
    Government strongly supported the establishment of metrological services as is
    well illustrated by the new K-SRI laboratories.
