abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Technical Investigation
    of the 2011 Joplin, MO tornado identified that no widely accepted standards exist
    for emergency communications in tornado events and more specifically, policies
    involving the use of communication systems to alert the public in advance of tornadoes.
    This study is designed to develop evidence-based guidance for communities on the
    creation and provision of public alerts, including both alerts provided by outdoor
    siren (warning) systems and short messages sent by social media or other short
    message service (SMS) platforms. It is the hope that this guidance can eventually
    be used as a basis for standardization, through codes and standards, of the procedures
    and policies for outdoor siren systems and short message alerts used by communities
    across the United States. Standardization of emergency communication policies
    and procedures could occur at multiple levels, including among multiple jurisdictions,
    state-wide, regionally, or even nationally. This document focuses on short message
    alerts, specifically presenting a review of platforms, usage and public response.
    First, an overview is provided on the current status of short message alerts in
    the United States, i.e., the current short message technology available and the
    ways in which this technology is used in communities across the United States.
    Second, a review of the literature is presented on the ways in which people respond
    to short message alerts and the current limitations of these systems in light
    of these findings. This document concludes with a discussion on the key findings
    and recommendations from the literature on the ways in which to improve current
    short message alerts, based on the methods by which people receive and process
    these types of alerts. Following this work, a document will be developed to provide
    the overall evidence-based guidance for communities on the creation and provision
    of public alerts.
