abstract:
- content: Ignitability of structural components due to ember accumulation is a common
    cause of structural fires in wildland urban interface (WUI) communities. To fire
    harden structures in WUI communities, it is important to quantitatively predict
    the ember ignitability of wooden substrates. To commence this effort, past studies
    have been compiled and analyzed to identify knowledge gaps. Key topics including
    ignition of structures in WUI fires, measurement of thermal response of solid
    wood products used in residential structures, controlling mechanisms in ignition
    and sustained smoldering of wood, measurement of ember properties, real-scale
    and bench-scale experiments on assessing ember ignitability of structural components,
    and surrogate ignition sources for assessing smoldering propensity of the wooden
    substrate have been reviewed. Existing test methods have also been reviewed in
    the light of common exposures seen WUI environment.
