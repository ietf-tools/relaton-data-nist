abstract:
- content: There is a need for cybersecurity capabilities and features to protect
    the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). However, cybersecurity
    requirements should not compromise the ability of first responders to complete
    their missions. In addition, the diversity of public safety disciplines means
    that one solution may not meet the usability and security needs of different disciplines.
    Understanding how public safety users operate in their different environments
    will allow for usable cybersecurity capabilities and features to be deployed and
    used. Although first responders work in a variety of disciplines, this report
    is focused on the Fire Service, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and Law Enforcement.
    This report describes the constraints presented by their personal protective equipment
    (PPE), specialized gear, and unique operating environments and how such constraints
    may interact with mobile authentication requirements. The overarching goal of
    this work is analyzing which authentication solutions are the most appropriate
    and usable for first responders using mobile devices in operational scenarios
    in the field.
