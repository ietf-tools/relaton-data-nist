abstract:
- content: Immediately following the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake of October
    17, 1989, a team representing the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction
    surveyed the damage to buildings, utilities and transportation structures. The
    report is based primarily on the data gathered during the site survey and the
    results of preliminary analyses of structural failures. Most structures designed
    in accordance with modern codes and standards performed well without serious structural
    damage. However, there were many concrete and masonry buildings and highway structures
    in the San Francisco Bay area which were not designed according to modern seismic
    design codes and which did not perform well. The majority of damaged structures
    had not been strengthened to increase earthquake resistance. Except for two deaths
    from landslides and one from fire, the remainder of the 62 deaths from the earthquake
    was due to partial or total collapse of older structures. The investigation provided
    the basis for recommendations to improve design and construction practices for
    buildings and lifeline structures and to mitigate damage to existing structures
    in future earthquakes.
