abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients
    Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat-
    and water-soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report
    describes the design of and results for the Winter 2015 MMQAP measurement comparability
    improvement studies: 1) Round Robin LXXVII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids
    in Human Serum and 2) Round Robin 42 Total Ascorbic Acid in Human Serum. The materials
    for both studies were shipped to participants in January 2015. To help reduce
    overhead costs and avoid raising participation fees, the materials for Round Robin
    LXXVIII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum and Round Robin 43
    Total Ascorbic Acid in Human Serum were also shipped in the same shipping container.
    Participants in Round Robins LXXVII and 42 were requested to provide measurement
    results by May 18, 2015.'
