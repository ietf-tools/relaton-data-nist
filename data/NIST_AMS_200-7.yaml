abstract:
- content: This primer provides an overview in using the Manufacturing Cost Guide.
    It explains how to use the tool and provides documentation on how the estimates
    are calculated in the tool. Specifically, this tool estimates the costs in US
    manufacturing, which can be used to help gauge the potential returns on manufacturing
    industry research projects. These costs are grouped into various standardized
    categories such as the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and
    the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system along with other non-standardized
    costs. Beta Version 0.1 of the tool is providing this information based upon data
    published in 2012. It is also important to note that this tool does not receive
    any updated data from the web; the tool outputs its results based upon static
    data that is embedded within the tool.
