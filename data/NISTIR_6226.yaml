abstract:
- content: In responding to ASHRAE SPC 155P's interest and to provide additional evidence
    on the envisioned linear relationship between output and input of a boiler under
    part load conditions, the National Institute of Standards and Technology undertook
    to conduct a series of computer simulations utilizing a revised version of a computer
    simulation program, DEPAB2, which was developed previously by NIST for commercial
    fire-tube steam boilers. The computer program was modified so that it can be used
    to simulate the operations of a commercial fire tube hot water boiler, and actual
    boiler specification data from a leading boiler manufacturer was obtained and
    used as input data to the program for the simulation study. In this paper, the
    computer model of a commercial hot water boiler and the actual boiler specification
    are described. Full and part-load performance of the simulated, commercial hot
    water boiler is presented. A good correlation between output energy and input
    energy is found. Based upon the correlationship, a suggestion is made to reduce
    experimental burden in testing the performance of commercial boilers.
