abstract:
- content: 'These 85 citations to the literature of benchmarking and workload definition
    were selected from a longer list of documents, encompassing a somewhat broader
    scope, that was submitted to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Task
    Group 13 in response to a request made to attendees of the Task Group''s Planning
    Session held on July 12, 1973, at the National Bureau of Standards. The bibliographic
    effort was to be directed not so much toward exhaustiveness as toward the development
    of a bibliography that the attendees had found useful and would, therefore, recommend
    to other workers in the field. Of the approximately 250 citations submitter to
    the Task Group, these 85 were selected on the basis of two criteria: (1) the item
    dealt primarily with benchmarking or workload definition; and (2) hard copy was
    available at the Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology.'
