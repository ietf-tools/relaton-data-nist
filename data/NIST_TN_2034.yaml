abstract:
- content: The definition of 'kind of quantity' given in the International Vocabulary
    of Metrology (VIM), 3rd edition, does not cover the historical meaning of the
    term as it is most commonly used in metrology. Most of its historical meaning
    has been merged into 'quantity,' which is polysemic across two layers of abstraction.
    I propose a model of 'kind of quantity' that is compatible with its historical
    meaning and distinguishable from 'quantity in a general sense.'
