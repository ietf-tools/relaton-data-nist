abstract:
- content: Wireless communication is becoming crucial to advanced manufacturing. Industry
    4.0 and Smart Manufacturing depend on networked industrial automation systems.
    The term Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been used to describe the deployment
    of interconnected machines, sensors, and actuators within modernized factories.
    The adoption of wireless systems is essential to these IIoT deployments. Wireless
    automation significantly reduces capital investment costs, including conduit,
    cables, networking equipment, and installation labor. To enable the adoption of
    wireless systems at the factory-floor level, wireless requirements must be established
    to realize the benefits of wireless communication systems within those factories.
    One challenge is that existing wireless standards lack technical specifications
    that support low-latency and high-reliability communication for factory applications.
    Additionally, requirements for such capabilities are published or advertised without
    validation of said requirements. Often, requirements published by standards development
    organizations appear excessively strict and invalidated by empirical study. Moreover,
    those requirements ignore the capabilities of the applications to use their own
    intelligence to compensate for lost reliability in the network. This report analyzes
    existing wireless user requirements stated by industry organizations, and it produces
    a combined perspective on wireless user requirements for the factory workcell
    with supporting rationale.
