abstract:
- content: The Special Publication contains infrared and mass spectra for a wide range
    of chlorofluoro-bromo ethanes and ethylenes that are relevant to research on alternative
    refrigerants. Alternative refrigerants are working fluids that are thought not
    to contribute significantly to atmospheric ozone depletion. In addition to the
    spectroscopic data, some physical property and safety information is included
    for each fluid as well. Not all of the compounds covered in the publication can
    be used as refrigerants. Indeed, some of them are in fact solids under ambient
    conditions, and others are fully halogenated, thus making them unfavorable from
    an ozone depletion standpoint. The study of all of these materials is important,
    however, since many will be found as impurities or reaction/decomposition products
    of refrigerant fluids. The publication provides a signal source for some particularly
    useful analytical information needed in the identification of these compounds.
