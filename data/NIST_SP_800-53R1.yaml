abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting
    and specifying security controls for information systems supporting the executive
    agencies of the federal government. The guidelines have been developed to help
    achieve more secure information systems within the federal government by: (i)
    facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting
    and specifying security controls for information systems; (ii) providing a recommendation
    for minimum security controls for information systems in accordance with Federal
    Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization
    of Federal Information and Information Systems and FIPS 200, Minimum Security
    Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems; (iii) promoting
    a dynamic, extensible catalog of security controls for information systems to
    meet the demands of changing requirements and technologies; and (iv) creating
    a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for determining
    security control effectiveness. The guidelines provided in this special publication
    are applicable to all federal information systems other than those systems designated
    as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section 3542. The guidelines
    have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement similar
    guidelines for national security systems.'
