abstract:
- content: Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, entitled the Federal Information
    Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, requires NIST to prepare an annual public
    report on activities undertaken in the previous year, and planned for the coming
    year, to carry out responsibilities under this law. The primary goal of the NIST
    s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity Program, is to provide
    standards and technology that protects information systems against threats to
    the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and services.
    During Fiscal Year 2017 (FY2017), ITL Cybersecurity Program successfully responded
    to numerous challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that mission. Through ITL's
    diverse research agenda and engagement in many national priority initiatives,
    high-quality, cost-effective security and privacy mechanisms were developed and
    applied that improved information security across the Federal Government and the
    greater information security community. This annual report highlights the research
    agenda and activities in which ITL Cybersecurity Program was engaged during FY
    2017.
