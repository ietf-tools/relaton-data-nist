abstract:
- content: The Transactive Energy (TE) Challenge Phase II Scenario was developed in
    a multi-step process in collaboration with industry experts. The Scenario enables
    comparison of results from different TE simulations and different TE approaches.
    The Scenario includes a common electric grid definition including attached loads
    and generators, weather, and reporting metrics. This document and the files that
    it references serve as a repository for future use.
