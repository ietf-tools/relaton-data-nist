abstract:
- content: Big Data is a term used to describe the large amount of data in the networked,
    digitized, sensor-laden, information-driven world. The growth of data is outpacing
    scientific and technological advances in data analytics. Opportunities exist with
    Big Data to address the volume, velocity and variety of data through new scalable
    architectures. To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working
    Group (NBD-PWG) is working to develop consensus on important, fundamental concepts
    related to Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability
    Framework (NBDIF) series of volumes. This volume, Volume 1, contains a definition
    of Big Data and related terms necessary to lay the groundwork for discussions
    surrounding Big Data.
