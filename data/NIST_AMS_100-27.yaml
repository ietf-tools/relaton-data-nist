abstract:
- content: 'Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are increasingly being studied
    and introduced into the modern industry, but for wide applications there exists
    some ''lack of confidence'' about the quality of the parts produced by AM. This
    distrust has an objective basis: it was shown that the final 3D object is a superposition
    of a huge number of tracks and layers, and deviations from the optimal process
    parameters can lead to non-regular shape, unmelted places (lack of fusion) and
    porosity. Experiments with different bare substrates were performed to classify
    instabilities and artifacts in single tracks derived from laser beam characteristics,
    the optical system, scanning strategy, etc. demonstrating an adjustment scheme
    for testing and verifying LPBF equipment. An important point is that this research
    can be useful for the custom experimental setup. The paper describes the importance
    of checking the system before each build to identify problems caused by optical
    system operation. Also, possible deviations from the stable process, methods of
    their diagnostics and solutions are described. The proposed method is a cost-free
    way to diagnose the stability of the selective laser melting, which does not imply
    the necessity of having additional systems for detecting problems. The diagnostic
    scheme was used to evaluate in situ diagnostics of the LPBF processes on the Additive
    Manufacturing Metrology Testbed (AMMT) at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST).'
