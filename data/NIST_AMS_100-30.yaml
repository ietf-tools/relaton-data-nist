abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the Standards
    Requirements Workshop for Natural Language Analysis on May 21, 2019, on the NIST
    Gaithersburg, Maryland campus. The purpose of the workshop was to discuss the
    current trends, successes, challenges, and standards requirements needs with respect
    to natural language document analysis for decision support in manufacturing. This
    report documents the event including the summarization of inclusive presentations
    and brainstorming sessions and identification of key themes. The next steps in
    this effort are presented towards the end of this document, including planning
    additional forums and meetings to further engage stakeholders on this important
    topic.
