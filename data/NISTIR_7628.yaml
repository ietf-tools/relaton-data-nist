    Smart Grid technologies will introduce millions of new intelligent components
    to the electric grid that communicate in much more advanced ways (e.g., two-way
    communications, and wired and wireless communications) than in the past. This
    report is for individuals and organizations who will be addressing cyber security
    for Smart Grid systems. The privacy recommendations, the security requirements,
    and the supporting analyses that are included in this report may be used by strategists,
    designers, implementers, and operators of the Smart Grid, e.g., utilities, equipment
    manufacturers, regulators, as input to their risk assessment process and other
    tasks in the security lifecycle of a Smart Grid information system. This report
    focuses on specifying an analytical framework that may be useful to an organization.
    It is a baseline, and each organization must develop its own cyber security strategy
    for the Smart Grid. The information in this report serves as guidance to various
    organizations for assessing risk and selecting appropriate security requirements
    and privacy recommendations."
