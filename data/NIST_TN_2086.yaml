abstract:
- content: Under the National Construction Safety Team Act, the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted an investigation of the May 22, 2011
    tornado in Joplin, Missouri. The final report concluded with a list of sixteen
    recommendations, including but not limited to recommendations for action in improved
    and standardized emergency communications. Specifically, NIST recommended "the
    development of national codes and standards and uniform guidance for clear, consistent,
    recognizable, and accurate emergency communications, encompassing alerts and warnings,
    to enable safe, effective, and timely responses." (Kuligowski et al. 2014, p.367)
    This is the third study in the NIST effort to develop evidence-based guidance
    on the creation and provision of public alerts. First, an overview of current
    popular social media platforms and the capabilities that they feature, as well
    as their potential application for emergency management is presented. Then, the
    findings of research related to social media use for disaster response are outlined
    in three themes. These themes are about the use of these tools for formal emergency
    management, innovative social media applications for disaster response, and how
    the general public uses these platforms, respectively. In turn, the findings of
    the research about social media use for disaster recovery are presented through
    three themes as well. These themes focus on social media during recovery for mental
    health, recovery assessment, and relationship development, respectively. The research
    findings are followed by the limitations and practical considerations for emergency
    managers. This report ends with the future research section.
