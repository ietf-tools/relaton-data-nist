abstract:
- content: Hotels have become targets for malicious actors wishing to exfiltrate sensitive
    data, deliver malware, or profit from undetected fraud. Property management systems,
    which are central to hotel operations, present attractive attack surfaces. This
    example implementation strives to increase the cybersecurity of the Property Management
    System (PMS) and offer privacy protections for the data in the PMS. The objective
    of this guide was to build a standards-based example implementation that utilizes
    readily available commercial off-the-shelf components that enhance the security
    of a PMS. The NCCoE at NIST built a PMS reference design in a laboratory environment
    to demonstrate methods to improve the cybersecurity of a PMS. The PMS reference
    design included the PMS, a credit card payment platform, and an analogous ancillary
    hotel system. In this example implementation, a physical access control system
    was used as the ancillary system. The principal capabilities include protecting
    sensitive data, enforcing role-based access control, and monitoring for anomalies.
    The principal recommendations include implementing cybersecurity concepts such
    as zero trust architecture, moving target defense, tokenization of credit card
    data, and role-based authentication. The PMS environment outlined in this guide
    encourages hoteliers and similar stakeholders to adopt effective cybersecurity
    and privacy concepts by using standard components that are composed of open-source
    and commercially available components.
