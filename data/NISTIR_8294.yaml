abstract:
- content: Electric vehicles are becoming common on the Nation's roads, and the electric
    vehicle supply equipment infrastructure (EVSE) is being created to support that
    growth. The NIST Information Technology Lab (ITL) hosted a one-day symposium to
    showcase federally funded research into the potential cybersecurity implications
    of EVSE.
