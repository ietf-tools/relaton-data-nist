abstract:
- content: This economic analysis brief summarizes the efforts and results of the
    data collection and analysis of NIST's CRADA partner information. Summary statistics
    for CRADA partners are provided for fiscal years 2006 through 2015. Included in
    the analysis are demographically descriptive variables such as the age, location,
    industry NAICS codes, number of employees and geographic distribution of NIST
    CRADA partners. Overall, these features provide an understanding of the demographic
    characteristics of companies that collaborate on NIST technologies.
