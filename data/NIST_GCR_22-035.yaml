abstract:
- content: This User s Manual is associated with the DAD_ETABS vesion 1.0 software
    based on the Database-Assisted Design (DAD) procedure for the design of high-rise
    steel buildings for wind, used in conjunction with the structural analysis and
    design program ETABS. For the design of structures for wind ETABS has so far been
    used in conjunction with static wind loads specified by building codes or wind
    engineering laboratories. The marriage of DAD with ETABS significantly enhances
    the capabilities of both programs. DAD allows the direct use of wind-tunnel measurements
    of time-varying pressure coefficients to determine the time-dependent wind loading
    induced by any directional wind speed. Structural and dynamic analyses performed
    by ETABS determine the dependence of any desired building response (i.e., member
    Demand-to-Capacity Indexes (DCI), inter-story drift ratios, floor accelerations)
    on wind speed and direction. Representations of this dependence, called response
    surfaces, are properties of the structure independent of wind climate. They are
    used to transform the matrix of the wind velocities at the building site into
    response matrices for as many responses as are required for structural design
    purposes. The elements of a response matrix are responses induced by their counterparts
    in the wind velocity matrix. For any response being considered, the vector whose
    components are the largest entry in each row of the response matrix is a data
    sample of the largest responses induced in the structure by the elements of the
    wind velocity matrix. The N-year response is obtained from that sample by using
    any appropriate extreme value estimation tool. The DAD_ETABS version 1.0 software
    was developed for the design of steel prismatic structures with rectangular shapes
    in plan. The User s Manual includes an example of the application of the software.
