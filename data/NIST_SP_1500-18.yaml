abstract:
- content: NIST is leading the development of the Research Data Framework (RDaF) with
    involvement and input from national and international leaders in the broad research
    data stakeholder community. Research data is defined here as the recorded factual
    material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate
    research findings. The overarching goal of the RDaF is to provide the stakeholder
    community with a structured approach to develop a customizable strategy for the
    management of research data. The audience for the RDaF is the entire research
    data community, including all organizations and individuals engaged in any activities
    concerned with research data management, from Chief Executive Officers and Chief
    Data Officers to librarians and researchers. This document describes the motivation
    for, and the development of, a Preliminary Framework Core, and identifies the
    next steps in further development of the RDaF. The research data environment is
    rapidly changing, and this Framework shall remain a living document. Revisions
    will be made as we, the stakeholders of the RDaF, gain experience with its application
    and use.
