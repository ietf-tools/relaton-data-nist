abstract:
- content: 'With the newly created Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN),
    the publicsafety community is in the process of supplementing the use of land
    mobile radios with atechnology ecosystem that will include a variety of new and
    improved communication tools, including a range of broadband data sharing platforms.
    As these technologies are beingdeveloped, researchers and industry alike need
    to focus on the end users – the firstresponders – in order to ensure successful
    and usable systems. Understanding the userpopulation of first respondersis key
    to improved usability. The National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST)
    Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Usability Team took amulti-phase,
    mixed methods approach in order to provide greater understanding of publicsafety
    technology users, their experiences, and their technology needs and problems.This
    report, Phase 1, Volume 5, is the 5th in a series of reports on the data from
    the Phase 1in-depth interviews. This report is a companion document and should
    be used in conjunctionwith the Phase 1, Volume 2 report that identifies the technology
    problems and needs of firstresponders from the in-depth interview data. The current
    report focuses on providingpractical guidance and recommendations for improving
    the usability of communicationtechnology for first responders by applying human
    factors and ergonomics (HFE) principlesand usability evaluation methodology. The
    field of HFE considers five major aspects (perceptual, cognitive, physical, environmental,
    and social & organizational) of humaninteractions with systems to optimize human
    well-being and overall system performance.In Phase 1 in-depth interviews, 193
    first responders–from Comm Center & 9-1-1 Services (COMMS), Emergency Medical
    Services (EMS), Fire Service (FF), and Law Enforcement (LE) –have been interviewed.
    A total of 107 categories of technology problems and needs wereidentified as documented
    in the Phase 1, Volume 2 report. In this report, from the usabilityand HFE perspectives,
    we performed further assessment on those 107 categories and dividedthem into two
    main groups. In the first group, 27 categories were clustered into 14 topics.For
    each of the 14 topics, specific HFE recommendations were made in order to ensure
    theusability of communication technology for first responders. In the other group,
    the remaining80 categories of technology problems and needs were clustered into
    6 topicsin which genericHFE considerations are applicable.To ensure the usability
    of communication technology for first responders, both groupsrequire a two-stage
    human-centered process to be followed for technology development andimplementation.
    The two-stage (requirement analysis and usability testing) process includes:(1)
    HFE professional(s) is integrated with the product team from the initiation and
    throughoutthe product development lifecycle; (2) at various stages, the product
    needs to go throughusability evaluations before the final implementation. The
    HFE professional must approvethat the product and technology meet the HFE and
    usability requirements to be ready forfinal implementation.The objective of this
    report is to provide concise and actionable HFE guidance andrecommendations to
    the PSCR R&D community without extensive discussions on thetheoretical background
    information. Practitioners interested in addressing a specific topic caniiThis
    publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8340take
    the recommendations, design and develop the technology following the two-stagehuman-centered
    process throughout the entire product development lifecycle to deliver thedesirable
    and usable communication technology to first responders.'
