abstract:
- content: The report describes and presents the results for text detection and recognition
    (TRAIT) evaluation in support of forensic investigations of digital media. These
    images are of interest to NIST's partner law enforcement agencies that seek to
    employ text recognition in investigating this area of serious crime. Our first
    evaluation uses images seized in child exploitation investigations. The primary
    application is the iden- tification of previously known victims and suspects,
    as well as detection of new victims and suspects. The presence of text, for example,
    on a wall poster or on an item of clothing, may allow a location to be identified
    and linked to prior cases. In total, 3 groups took part in this evaluation over
    three Phases. The evaluation results show that the initial performance of text
    recognition is low. However, from Phase 1 to Phase 3, the performance of text
    recognition algorithms has shown improvement. We hope this evaluation will stir
    more research in this field.
