abstract:
- content: This report describes a phase detector circuit capable of providing a large
    DC output voltage isolated from ground. The Circuit employs a gated beam vacuum
    tube or similar coincidence device to produce a carrier signal amplitude-modulated
    as a function of the relative phase shift between two input signals. The resulting
    carrier may be coupled across any desired DC potential, and then demodulated with
    a simple AM detector. Output voltages as high as 500 volts have been obtained
    with the circuit.
