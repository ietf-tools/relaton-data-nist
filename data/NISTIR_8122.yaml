abstract:
- content: This guide describes how to use the STEP File Analyzer, a software tool
    that analyzes and generates a spreadsheet from a STEP (STandard for the Exchange
    of Product model data) file. The spreadsheets simplify inspecting information
    in the STEP file at an entity and attribute level. STEP files can also be checked
    for conformance to recommended practices for Product and Manufacturing Information
    (PMI) representation, PMI presentation, and validation properties.
