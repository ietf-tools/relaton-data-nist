abstract:
- content: 'NIST Special Publication (SP) 922 is an aid in the identification of the
    chemical structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The Structure
    Index consists of two parts: (1) a cross index of named PAHs listed in alphabetical
    order and (2) chemical structures including ring numbering, name(s), Chemical
    Abstract Service (CAS) Registry numbers, chemical formulas, molecular weights,
    and length-to-breadth ratios (L/B) and shape descriptors of PAHs listed in order
    of increasing molecular weight.'
