abstract:
- content: Medical devices, such as infusion pumps, were once standalone instruments
    that interacted only with the patient or medical provider. However, today's medical
    devices connect to a variety of healthcare systems, networks, and other tools
    within a healthcare delivery organization (HDO). Connecting devices to point-of-care
    medication systems and electronic health records can improve healthcare delivery
    processes; however, increasing connectivity capabilities also creates cybersecurity
    risks. Potential threats include unauthorized access to patient health information,
    changes to prescribed drug doses, and interference with a pump's function.
