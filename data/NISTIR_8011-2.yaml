abstract:
- content: The NISTIR 8011 volumes focus on each individual information security capability,
    adding tangible detail to the more general overview given in NISTIR 8011 Volume
    1, and providing a template for transition to a detailed, NIST standards-compliant
    automated assessment. This document, Volume 2 of NISTIR 8011, addresses the Hardware
    Asset Management (HWAM) information security capability. The focus of the HWAM
    capability is to manage risk created by unmanaged devices on a network. Unmanaged
    devices are targets that attackers can use to gain and more easily maintain a
    persistent platform from which to attack the rest of the network.
