abstract:
- content: Resistance strain gages of the SS-E-4D-A series, manufactured by Micro-Test,
    Inc., were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The characteristics determined
    were (1) gage factor at room temperature, (2) variation of gage factor with increasing
    temperature, (3) drift, (4)resistance-temperature relationship, (5) behavior under
    transient heating conditions, and (6) behavior when subjected to large strains.
    The results of these tests indicate that these gages, when attached to stainless
    steel, have repeatable gage factor characteristics, a very low temperature coefficient
    of resistance, low drift at temperatures up to 700¿̐¿ F, and the ability to withstand
    large tensile strains without failure.
