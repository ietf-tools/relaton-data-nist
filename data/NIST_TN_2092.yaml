abstract:
- content: Effective July 1, 2007, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission promulgated
    a Standard that would severely reduce the heat release rate and the early heat
    output from mattresses and foundations that had been ignited by a flaming ignition
    source. Mattresses complying with this Standard have now been sold for more than
    a decade. This study establishes a methodology for evaluating the effect of this
    Standard on the number of bed fires and the extent of their fire spread, fatalities,
    and injuries, and then estimates the Standard's success over its first decade.
    Because it is possible there were changes other than the Standard that affected
    the outcome of bed fires, the study normalized the changes to the numbers of residential
    upholstered furniture (RUF) fires, all residential fires, and all bed fires. The
    Standard is accomplishing its purpose, resulting in considerable reductions in
    fatalities and injuries from bed fires ignited by flaming sources. Approximately
    65 fatalities were prevented annually during the two-year period 2015-2016. Relative
    to RUF fires, flaming ignitions of beds led to decreases in the numbers of fires
    by 12 %, injuries by 34 %, and deaths by 82 % between 2005-2006 and 2015-2016.
    Per bed fire, injuries decreased by 25 % and fatalities decreased by 67 %. The
    decreases in injuries and, especially, fatalities are larger than the decrease
    in the number of fires, suggesting that the most severe fires are being prevented
    by the Standard. There was no systematic evidence that the calculations were significantly
    affected by (1) the calculation method for calculating the replacement rate of
    pre-Standard mattresses, (2) variability in fire reporting among fire departments,
    (3) whether the initial combustible was reported as the mattress or bedding, or
    (4) whether the mattress or bedding was reported as the item most contributing
    to flame spread.
