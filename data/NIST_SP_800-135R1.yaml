abstract:
- content: Cryptographic keys are vital to the security of internet security applications
    and protocols. Many widely-used internet security protocols have their own application-specific
    Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) that are used to generate the cryptographic keys
    required for their cryptographic functions. This Recommendation provides security
    requirements for those KDFs.
