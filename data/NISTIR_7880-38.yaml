abstract:
- content: 'From 1984 to 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    coordinated the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for
    laboratories that measure fat soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum
    and plasma. This report describes the design of and results for the Spring and
    Fall 1986 MMQAP measurement comparability improvement studies: 1) Round Robin
    VII Fat Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum and 2) Round Robin VIII
    Fat Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum. The first participant results
    for Round Robin VII were received March 5, 1986; the last results were received
    April 29, 1986. The first participant results for Round Robin VIII were received
    October 30, 1986; the last results were received February 6, 1987.'
