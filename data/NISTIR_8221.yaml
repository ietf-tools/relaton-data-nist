abstract:
- content: Hardware/Server Virtualization is a key feature of data centers used for
    cloud computing services and enterprise computing that enables ubiquitous access
    to shared system resources. Server virtualization is typically performed by a
    hypervisor, which provides mechanisms to abstract hardware and system resources
    from an operating system. Hypervisors are large pieces of software with several
    thousand lines of code and are therefore known to have vulnerabilities. This document
    analyzes the recent vulnerabilities associated with two open- source hypervisors
    - Xen and KVM - as reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's
    (NIST) National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and develops a profile of those
    vulnerabilities in terms of hypervisor functionality, attack type, and attack
    source. Based on the predominant number of vulnerabilities in a hypervisor functionality
    (attack vector), two sample attacks using those attack vectors were launched to
    exploit those vulnerabilities, and the associated system calls were logged. The
    objective was to determine the evidence coverage for detecting and reconstructing
    those attacks and identify techniques required to gather missing evidence.
