abstract:
- content: 'This document presents cloud access control characteristics and a set
    of general access control guidance for cloud service models: IaaS (Infrastructure
    as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service).
    Different service delivery models require managing different types of access on
    offered service components. Such service models can be considered hierarchical,
    thus the access control guidance of functional components in a lower-level service
    model are also applicable to the same functional components in a higher-level
    service model. In general, access control guidance for IaaS is also applicable
    to PaaS and SaaS, and access control guidance for IaaS and PaaS is also applicable
    to SaaS. However, each service model has its own focus with regard to access control
    requirements for its service.'
