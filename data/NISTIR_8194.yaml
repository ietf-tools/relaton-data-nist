abstract:
- content: Phishing, the transmission of a message spoofing a legitimate sender about
    a legitimate subject with intent to perform malicious activity, causes a tremendous
    and rapidly-increasing amount of damage to American information systems and users
    annually. This project implements an exploratory computational model of user decision
    making in a potential phishing attack scenario. The model demonstrates how contextual
    factors, such as message subject matter match to current work concerns, and personality
    factors, such as conscientiousness, contribute to users' decisions to comply with
    or ignore message requests.
