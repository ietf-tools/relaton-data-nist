abstract:
- content: This document is the third in a series that supplements NIST Interagency/Internal
    Report (NISTIR) 8286, Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management
    (ERM). This series provides additional details regarding the enterprise application
    of cybersecurity risk information; the previous documents, NISTIRs 8286A and 8286B,
    provided details regarding stakeholder risk direction and methods for assessing
    and managing cybersecurity risk in light of enterprise objectives. NISTIR 8286C
    describes how information, as recorded in cybersecurity risk registers (CSRRs),
    may be integrated as part of a holistic approach to ensuring that risks to information
    and technology are properly considered for the enterprise risk portfolio. This
    cohesive understanding supports an enterprise risk register (ERR) and enterprise
    risk profile (ERP) that, in turn, support the achievement of enterprise objectives.
