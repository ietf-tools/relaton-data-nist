abstract:
- content: We describe here the calibration of customer hygrometers using the NIST
    Hybrid Humidity Generator (HHG). This generator produces humidified air with water
    amount fractions (water mole fractions) ranging from 1.0 10?7 to 0.57 using calibration
    gas flows up to 150 standard liters per minute. At ambient pressure these amount
    fractions correspond to dew/frost points ranging from 90 C to +85 C. The HHG may
    be used to calibrate instruments measuring water amount fraction, such as cavity
    ring-down hygrometers. It may also be used to calibrate chilled-mirror hygrometers
    measuring dew/frost-point temperature when an additional pressure measurement
    is made at the inlet of the hygrometer. Finally, the HHG may be used to provide
    humidified air for the calibration of relative humidity sensors in a temperature-controlled
    test chamber; for this, an additional temperature measurement is made in the chamber.
    These sensors may be calibrated over the range 2 % to 98 % for temperatures between
    ?34 C and 85 C. The HHG combines the two-pressure and divided-flow humidity generation
    methods (hence the name hybrid ). The centerpiece of the HHG is a heat exchanger/saturator
    that is immersed in a temperature-controlled bath stable to within 1 mK. For dew/frost-point
    temperatures that are above 10.3 C, the two-pressure method is employed. For frost
    points at or below 10.3 C, the water-vapor/air mixture is produced by mixing metered
    streams of moist air produced by the two-pressure method with purified, dry air.
    In this special publication, we describe the design of the generator and its test
    chamber. We also describe a series of performance and validation tests on the
    HHG and its test chamber and use the results of these to construct an uncertainty
    budget for the generator when used in two-pressure mode and when used in the divided-flow
    mode. These tests include measurements of temperature gradients and pressure stability
    in the generator under various operating conditions, and comparison of the humidity
    generated by the HHG to that generated or measured by the other NIST humidity
    standards. For dew/frost-point temperatures, the uncertainty budget yields a total
    expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of less than 0.025 C for dew/frost-point temperatures
    above 60 C. For amount fraction, the budget yields a total expanded relative uncertainty
    of less than 0.2 % for amount fractions above 2 10?5. For relative humidity in
    the test chamber, the budget yields a total expanded relative uncertainty of less
    than 0.3 %.
