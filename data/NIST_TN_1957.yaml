abstract:
- content: Building stakeholders need practical metrics, data, and tools to support
    decisions related to sustainable building designs, technologies, standards, and
    codes. The Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has addressed this high priority national need by extending its metrics
    and tools for sustainable building products, known as Building for Environmental
    and Economic Sustainability (BEES), to whole buildings. Whole building sustainability
    metrics have been developed based on innovative extensions to life-cycle assessment
    (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches involving whole building energy
    simulations. The measurement system evaluates the sustainability of both the materials
    and the energy used by buildings over time. It assesses the ⁰₋carbon footprint⁰₊
    of buildings as well as 11 other environmental performance metrics, and integrates
    economic performance metrics to yield science-based measures of the business case
    for investment choices in high-performance green buildings. Building Industry
    Reporting and Design for Sustainability (BIRDS) applies the sustainability measurement
    system to an extensive whole building performance database NIST has compiled for
    this purpose. Based on the NIST Net Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF),
    the BIRDS low energy residential building database includes energy, environmental,
    and cost measurements for 480 000 residential building designs for Gaithersburg,
    MD for study period lengths ranging from 1 year to 40 years. Focusing on a single
    location allows for the consideration of incremental building energy efficiency
    measures, both those specified in most recent editions of the International Energy
    Conservation Code (IECC) as well as those adopted in the NZERTF design that lead
    to net-zero energy performance. The sustainability performance of buildings designed
    to meet current energy codes can be compared to a number of alternative building
    designs to determine the impacts of improving building energy efficiency on overall
    sustainability performance. The initial version of this database was introduced
    in BIRDS v3.0 and has been expanded in BIRDS v3.1 to include additional metrics
    related to indoor environmental quality (thermal comfort of occupants and indoor
    air quality) and an additional exterior wall finish option. The BIRDS interface
    now includes additional graphing features not available in previous versions of
    BIRDS. This document is a tutorial to assist BIRDS users in understanding and
    using the BIRDS Low Energy Residential Buildings Database Web Interface, including
    detailed definitions for and explanation of the purpose of each input and output
    option.
