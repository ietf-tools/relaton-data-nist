abstract:
- content: This report estimates biomanufacturing (manufactured products made of biomaterials)
    and advanced biomanufacturing (products manufactured using activities that grow
    biological molecules and materials along with activities that alter biological
    material using non-mechanical means) value added in ways that make it consistent
    with estimates of U.S. GDP. Advanced biomanufacturing is estimated as being $94.6
    billion while total biomanufacturing is $438.8 billion. When including supply
    chain items and other indirect value added, the total biomanufacturing industry
    is $1363.8 billion and advanced biomanufacturing is $259.9 billion. These estimates
    include biomanufacturing items that are excluded from estimates of the bioeconomy
    made by other organizations and/or individuals. Other U.S. estimates have also
    been inconsistent with measures of GDP or value added. As calculated using NISTâ€™s
    Manufacturing Cost Guide, the biomanufacturing industry impact accounts for 43
    % of the total U.S. impact while advanced biomanufacturing is 6.4 %. This report
    also examines the assets, material flow time, fuels, and electricity used in biomanufacturing.
