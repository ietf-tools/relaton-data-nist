abstract:
- content: As an exploratory analysis, demographic data from the 2000 Census and 2011
    American Community Survey at the Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) code level are used
    in conjunction with damage estimates from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
    (FEMA) to model the effects of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season on Florida.
    Data on the number of establishments by industry and ZIP code were obtained from
    the Census County Business Patterns datasets. To prevent the 2007 to 2009 recession
    from adding a convoluting effect, a time period from 2000 to 2006 was selected.
    The analysis also assumes that the 2004 season was a distinct and severe enough
    event that its impacts are distinguishable from general trends in the data. Analysis
    was also broken into coastal regions and inland regions to lessen any possible
    endogeneity. The change in the number of establishments was selected as the independent
    variable as specific data on closures and the reasons why were unavailable. A
    difference in differences, as well as a graphical, analysis on the change in number
    of establishments indicate reasons to view 2004 as a significant event, however
    due to the multitude of convoluting factors affecting a state's economy it is
    impossible to attribute the full effect to the 2004 season. Fixed effect regressions
    using first differences were also run looking at the impact of demographic factors
    on the change in number of establishments. Regression results were rendered inconsistent
    by an endogeneity issue; however the general method here did produce interesting
    results when incorporating time-fixed effects. The regression results imply demographics
    have a mixed impact; bearing in mind the estimator was inconsistent due to endogeneity.
    Overall the developed process seems viable for use in other instances, provided
    more complete data is available.
