abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information
    Technology Laboratory, Computer Security Division, has developed this S/MIME (Secure
    / Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) client profile as guidance in the development
    and procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) S/MIME-compliant products.
    This profile document identifies requirements for a secure and interoperable S/MIME
    V3 client implementation. NIST is developing tests and testing tools to determine
    the level of conformance of an S/MIME V3 client implementation with this profile.
