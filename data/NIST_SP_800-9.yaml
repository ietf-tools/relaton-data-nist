abstract:
- content: Electronic commerce (EC) is the use of documents in electronic form, rather
    than paper, for carrying out functions of business or government that require
    interchange of information, obligations, or monetary value between organizations.
    Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the computer-to-computer transmission of
    strictly formatted messages that represent documents; EDI is an essential component
    of EC. With EC, human participation in routine transaction processing is limited
    or non-existent. Transactions are processed and decisions are made more rapidly,
    leaving much less time to detect and correct errors. This report presents security
    procedures and techniques (which encompass internal controls and checks) that
    constitute good practices in the design, development, testing and operation of
    EC systems. Principles of risk management and definition of parameters for quantitative
    risk assessments are provided. The content of the trading partner agreement is
    discussed, and the components of EC, including the network(s) connecting the partners,
    are described. Some security techniques considered include audit trails, contingency
    planning, use of acknowledgments, electronic document management, activities of
    supporting networks, user access controls to systems and networks, and cryptographic
    techniques for authentication and confidentiality.
