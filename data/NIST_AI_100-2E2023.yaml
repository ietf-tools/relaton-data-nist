abstract:
- content: This NIST AI report develops a taxonomy of concepts and defines terminology
    in the field of adversarial machine learning (AML). The taxonomy is built on survey
    of the AML literature and is arranged in a conceptual hierarchy that includes
    key types of ML methods and lifecycle stage of attack, attacker goals and objectives,
    and attacker capabilities and knowledge of the learning process. The report also
    provides corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the consequences of
    attacks and points out relevant open challenges to take into account in the lifecycle
    of AI systems. The terminology used in the report is consistent with the literature
    on AML and is complemented by a glossary that defines key terms associated with
    the security of AI systems and is intended to assist non-expert readers. Taken
    together, the taxonomy and terminology are meant to inform other standards and
    future practice guides for assessing and managing the security of AI systems,
    by establishing a common language and understanding of the rapidly developing
    AML landscape.
