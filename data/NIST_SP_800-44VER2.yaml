abstract:
- content: Web servers are often the most targeted and attacked hosts on organizations'
    networks. As a result, it is essential to secure Web servers and the network infrastructure
    that supports them. This document is intended to assist organizations in installing,
    configuring, and maintaining secure public Web servers. Practices described in
    detail include choosing Web server software and platforms, securing the underlying
    operating system and Web server software, deploying appropriate network protection
    mechanisms, and using, publicizing, and protecting information in a careful and
    systematic manner. The publication also provides recommendations for maintaining
    secure configurations through patching and upgrades, security testing, log monitoring,
    and backups of data and operating system files.
