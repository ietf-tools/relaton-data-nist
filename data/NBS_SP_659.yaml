abstract:
- content: 'This report presents a long-range plan for roofing research. The plan
    was developed in response to a need for roofing research addressing major materials
    problems and changes in low-sloped roofing materials technology. The intent of
    the plan is to establish the technical basis for developing standards and minimum
    levels of performance to assist in the selection of cost-effective and durable
    roofing materials. Four major areas of needed research are identified: low-sloped
    roofing systems, roofing membranes including single-ply and built-up, thermal
    insulation for roofing systems, and condition assessment and repair of roofs.
    Within each research area, a goal is given as well as a number of objectives to
    achieve the goal. A recommended approach to accomplish each objective is also
    given.'
