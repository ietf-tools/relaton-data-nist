abstract:
- content: One of the basic tenets of zero trust is to remove the implicit trust in
    users, services, and devices based only on their network location, affiliation,
    and ownership. NIST Special Publication 800-207 has laid out a comprehensive set
    of zero trust principles and referenced zero trust architectures (ZTA) for turning
    those concepts into reality. A key paradigm shift in ZTAs is the change in focus
    from security controls based on segmentation and isolation using network parameters
    (e.g., IP addresses, subnets, perimeter) to identities. From an application security
    point of view, this requires authentication and authorization policies based on
    application and service identities in addition to the underlying network parameters
    and user identities. This in turn requires a platform that consists of API gateways,
    sidecar proxies, and application identity infrastructures (e.g., Secure Production
    Identity Framework for Everyone [SPIFFE]) that can enforce those policies irrespective
    of the location of the services or applications, whether on-premises or on multiple
    clouds. The objective of this publication is to provide guidance for realizing
    an architecture that can enforce granular application-level policies while meeting
    the runtime requirements of ZTA for multi-cloud and hybrid environments.
