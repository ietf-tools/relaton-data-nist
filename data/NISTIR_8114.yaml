abstract:
- content: NIST-approved cryptographic standards were designed to perform well using
    general-purpose computers. In recent years, there has been increased deployment
    of small computing devices that have limited resources with which to implement
    cryptography. When current NIST-approved algorithms can be engineered to fit into
    the limited resources of constrained environments, their performance may not be
    acceptable. For these reasons, NIST started a lightweight cryptography project
    that was tasked with learning more about the issues and developing a strategy
    for the standardization of lightweight cryptographic algorithms. This report provides
    an overview of the lightweight cryptography project at NIST, and describes plans
    for the standardization of lightweight cryptographic algorithms.
