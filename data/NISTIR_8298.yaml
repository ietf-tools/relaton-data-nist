abstract:
- content: 'Within a variety of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications, maturity
    levels can vary significantly depending upon modeling approach and the user''s
    knowledge and skills. Recently, application of CFD techniques for Computational
    Wind Engineering (CWE) has generated strong interest among wind and structural
    engineers as a possible substitute for or supplement to wind tunnel experimentation,
    even though CWE is still in a developmental stage. A necessary step toward advancing
    CWE simulations in wind and structural engineering applications credible is the
    development of reliable verification and validation (V&V) procedures. Fundamental
    factors that determine the degree to which CWE simulations are the credible include:
    (i) the quality of the mathematical modeling of the physics of interest; (ii)
    the depth of understanding by the users/analysts of the details of the model and
    the simulation results; (iii) the quality of the verification and validation (V&V)
    procedures applied to the simulation results, and (iv) the quality of the uncertainty
    quantification procedure applied to those results. This report deals in detail
    with the sources of inaccuracy in CFD simulations, and concepts and procedures
    used in V&V and uncertainty quantification.'
