abstract:
- content: 'Product integrity and the ability to distinguish trustworthy products
    is a critical foundation of C-SCRM. Authoritative information regarding the provenance
    and integrity of components provides a strong basis for trust in a computing device
    whether it is a client device, server, or other technology. The goal of this project
    is to demonstrate how organizations can verify that the components of their acquired
    computing devices are genuine and have not been tampered with or otherwise modified
    throughout the devices'' life cycles. This project addresses several processes:
    how to create verifiable descriptions of components and platforms, which may be
    done by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), platform integrators, and even
    information technology (IT) departments how to verify devices and components within
    the single transaction between an OEM and a customer how to verify devices and
    components at subsequent stages in the system life cycle in the operational environment.
    This project will use a combination of commercial off-the-shelf and open-source
    tools to describe the components of a device in a verifiable manner using cryptography.
    Future builds of this project may cover other critical phases of C-SCRM.'
