abstract:
- content: Thirteen different flush mounted pressure transducers of seven different
    manufacturers were tested by applying a thermal gradient to them and recording
    their resultant zero shifts. Photographs of typical outputs are shown and the
    results are compared. Some suggestions for possible improvements are given.
