abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of this executive summary is to provide key stakeholders with
    relevant information about how PSCR spent Public Safety Trust Funds and the impacts
    of that funding. Furthermore, this report seeks to demonstrate the value and positive
    outcomes of a one-time injection of funds into a topic area and the extent to
    which this model can be repeated in other areas of significant impact, such as
    semiconductor supply or climate change. PSCR extensively tracked its impacts since
    2016, aligning them across five leading indicators: research capacity, disruptive
    approaches and technology, standards, products, and public safety methods. Furthermore,
    data from extramural award recipients, prize challenge competitors, and accelerator
    program participants have been included to provide a more holistic view of programmatic
    impact. However, only preliminary data is included in this executive summary and
    a more complete and comprehensive report with additional analysis is scheduled
    to be published in spring 2023.'
