abstract:
- content: Polymer and other coatings are commonly used to protect, enhance or decorate
    wood, plastic and metal products used in homes and other buildings. Nanoparticles
    (i.e., particles having at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm) are increasingly
    being added to coating formulations to reduce damage as well as to enhance their
    performance. Because of their small size and large surface area, nanomaterials
    may exhibit unique physical, chemical and transport behaviors in the environment
    and in the human body. Research in recent years has indicated that nanoparticles
    may be potentially harmful to the environment and to human health. In order to
    better understand human exposure associated with the airborne release of such
    particles, material specimens with coatings containing nanoparticles were tested
    in a small environmental chamber in which coated materials were subjected to surface
    abrasion intended to simulate normal wear and tear. This report describes the
    experimental approach and the results obtained, which showed minimal airborne
    release of the nanoparticles in the tested coatings.
