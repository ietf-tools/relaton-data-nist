abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently
    developing reference materials (RMs) to support the corn-to-ethanol industry.
    Two candidate RMs consisting of dried corn biomass intermediates before and after
    conversion (fermentation) were obtained from commercial ethanol plant facilities.
    Interlaboratory studies will be used to screen the candidate RMs. This report
    describes the results of an interlaboratory study for laboratories analyzing starch
    content for these two candidate RMs and for two starch-based control materials.
