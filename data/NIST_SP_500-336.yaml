abstract:
- content: This guidance specifies a protocol and associated metrics for the evaluation
    of contactless fingerprint acquisition device, and their interoperability with
    legacy devices. This protocol enables contactless fingerprint developers seeking
    certification of their devices to perform an integral role in the collection of
    measurements by which their device will be evaluated by the certifying authority
    or other stakeholders. The NIST Fingerprint Registration and Comparison Tool (NFRaCT)
    enables interested parties seeking testing for certification to collect fingerprint
    images and performance measurements using the NFRaCT and provide those measurements
    to the certifying authority for analysis and evaluation without requiring the
    exchange of any underlying fingerprint images. The protocol provides flexibility
    in that device performance can be evaluated and validated using live fingerprint
    impressions or three-dimensional (3D) fingerprint target artifacts.
