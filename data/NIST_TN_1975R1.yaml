abstract:
- content: Building stakeholders need practical metrics, data, and tools to support
    decisions related to sustainable building designs, technologies, standards, and
    codes. The Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has addressed this high priority national need by extending its metrics
    and tools for sustainable building products, known as Building for Environmental
    and Economic Sustainability (BEES), to whole-buildings. Wholebuilding sustainability
    metrics have been developed based on innovative extensions to life-cycle assessment
    (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches involving whole-building energy
    simulations. The measurement system evaluates the sustainability of both the materials
    and the energy used by a building over time. It assesses the carbon footprint
    of buildings as well as 11 other environmental performance metrics and integrates
    economic performance metrics to yield science-based measures of the business case
    for investment choices in high-performance, green buildings. Building Industry
    Reporting and Design for Sustainability (BIRDS) applies the sustainability measurement
    system to an extensive whole-building performance database NIST has compiled for
    this purpose. In addition to the database developed for previous versions of BIRDS,
    the updated BIRDS Commercial database now includes energy, environmental, and
    cost measurements for 13 680 new commercial and non-low rise residential buildings,
    covering the 15 building prototypes based on the PNNL Commercial Prototype Building
    Models in 228 cities across all U.S. states for study period lengths ranging from
    1 year to 40 years. The sustainability performance of buildings designed to meet
    current state energy codes can be compared to their performance when meeting four
    alternative building energy standard editions to determine the impact of energy
    efficiency on sustainability performance. The impact of the building location
    and the investor's time horizon on sustainability performance can also be measured.
