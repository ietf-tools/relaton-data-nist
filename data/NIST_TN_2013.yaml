abstract:
- content: In recent years, building designers and community planners have recognized
    the importance of taking an integrated approach to sustainability and resilience,
    but in practical application this dual objective approach is not often intentionally
    realized. For some time, the two efforts have been largely disconnected despite
    overlapping agendas and shared co-benefits. A building cannot be classified as
    sustainable if it is not durable enough to withstand the impacts of natural disasters
    and maintain its functional resilience. Therefore, formally integrating the two
    concepts is important to ensure the development of long-term sustainable residential
    and commercial buildings that can withstand the increasing large-scale disaster
    events of greater magnitude than ever before. A common deterrent for many homeowners
    to invest in sustainable building elements are the significant upfront costs required.
    However, the economic viability of such investments can be improved if homeowners
    facing hazard events or stressors see their investments in sustainability as a
    way to increase the resilience of their homes to disasters, benefiting from the
    monetization of numerous direct and/or indirect cost savings or losses avoided.
    A case study based on a single-family home in Maryland with an installed rooftop
    solar photovoltaic (PV) system with the option for additional battery storage
    is used to reveal the potential effects of considering resilience benefits in
    economic analyses of investments in residential sustainability. The results of
    an environmental impact assessment are then used to reveal underlying tradeoffs
    between investments in building sustainability (indirect resilience) and a building's
    environmental footprint.
