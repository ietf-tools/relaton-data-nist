abstract:
- content: This study was conducted by the National Institute of Building Sciences
    Building Seismic Safety Council (BSSC). The goal was to develop standardized categories
    for older concrete buildings that incorporate more detail than those included
    in the standard set of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Concrete Model
    Building Types, namely, C1-frames, C2-shear walls, C3-concrete frames with masonry
    infill, and PC2-precast frames. The recommended subtypes generally can be identified
    without extensive engineering evaluation and therefore can document the inventory
    of older concrete buildings in an effort to better quantify how many structures
    might require mitigation. The identification of these subtypes also contributes
    to determination of the highest priority research needed to enable rapid implementation
    of performance-based seismic design for mitigation.
