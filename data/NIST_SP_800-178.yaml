abstract:
- content: Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) and Next Generation Access
    Control (NGAC) are very different attribute based access control (ABAC) standards
    with similar goals and objectives. An objective of both is to provide a standardized
    way for expressing and enforcing vastly diverse access control policies on various
    types of data services. However, the two standards differ with respect to the
    manner in which access control policies are specified and implemented. This document
    describes XACML and NGAC, and then compares them with respect to five criteria.
    The goal of this publication is to help ABAC users and vendors make informed decisions
    when addressing future data service policy enforcement requirements.
