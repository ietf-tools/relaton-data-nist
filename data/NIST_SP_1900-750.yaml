abstract:
- content: The transactive energy (TE) abstract component model ('Model') was the
    product of a tiger team effort engaged by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST), Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL), Vanderbilt University,
    and Carnegie Mellon University during the summer of 2016 in support of the NIST
    Transactive Energy Challenge. The purpose of this activity was to distill from
    the collective experience of the participants an abstract model of a transactive
    energy system consisting of an energy grid, loads, generators, controllers, and
    transactive agents.
