abstract:
- content: 'This report presents the summary of a workshop held at NIST on March 15-16,
    2018 on the topic of applied category theory (ACT). The meeting had two main goals:
    (i) mapping the current ACT landscape and (ii) developing a roadmap for transitioning
    the field to concrete applications. The report is broken into six sections detailing
    different aspects relevant to the development of ACT: community development, domain-specific
    applications, pedagogy, tool support, marketing and funding. Each section contains
    a discussion of the current state of the field, identifies major goals and challenges
    in that area, and considers potential strategies and tactics to address them,
    along with a prospective timeline for future developments.'
