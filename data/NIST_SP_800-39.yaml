abstract:
- content: The purpose of Special Publication 800-39 is to provide guidance for an
    integrated, organization-wide program for managing information security risk to
    organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational
    assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the operation
    and use of federal information systems. Special Publication 800-39 provides a
    structured, yet flexible approach for managing information security risk that
    is intentionally broad-based, with the specific details of assessing, responding
    to, and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis provided by other supporting NIST
    security standards and guidelines. The guidance provided in this publication is
    not intended to replace or subsume other risk-related activities, programs, processes,
    or approaches that organizations have implemented or intend to implement addressing
    areas of risk management covered by other legislation, directives, policies, programmatic
    initiatives, or mission/business requirements. Rather, the information security
    risk management guidance described herein is complementary to and can be used
    as part of a more comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program.
