abstract:
- content: This report documents an experimental program designed to investigate High
    Energy Arcing Fault (HEAF) phenomena for medium voltage electrical switchgear
    containing aluminum conductors. This report covers full-scale laboratory experiments
    using representative nuclear power plant (NPP) three-phase electrical equipment.
    Electrical, thermal, and pressure data were recorded for each test and documented
    in this report. This report covers four of the fourteen planned medium voltage
    electrical enclosure tests. Subsequent reports will document the additional tests
    performed in the future. The experiments were performed at KEMA Labs located in
    Chalfont, Pennsylvania. The experimental design, setup, and execution were completed
    by staff from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)
    and KEMA. In addition, representatives from the Electric Power Research Institute
    (EPRI) observed some of the test setup and execution. The HEAF tests were performed
    on four near-identical units of General Electric metal-clad medium voltage switchgear.
    The three-phase arcing fault was initiated on the primary cable connection bus.
    All four tests used the same system voltage (6.9 kV) but varied the current and
    duration. Real-time electrical operating conditions, including voltage, current
    and frequency, were measured during the experiments. Heat fluxes and incident
    energies were measured with plate thermometers and slug calorimeters at various
    locations around the electrical enclosures. Internal enclosure pressures were
    measured during the experiments. The experiments were documented with normal and
    high-speed videography, infrared imaging and photography. Insights from this testing
    included timing information related to enclosure breach, event progression, mass
    loss measurements for electrodes and steel enclosures, peak pressure rise, particle
    analysis, along with visual and thermal imaging data to better understand and
    characterize the hazard. These results will be used in subsequent efforts to advance
    the state of knowledge related to HEAF.
