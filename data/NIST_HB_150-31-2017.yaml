abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 150-31 presents the technical requirements and guidance for
    the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
    Program (NVLAP) Health Information Technology Testing program. It is intended
    for information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation,
    laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing
    information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2017
    edition of NIST Handbook 150-31 supersedes and replaces the 2011 edition. The
    requirements of NIST Handbook 150 and the specific requirements and interpretations
    in NIST Handbook 150-31 must be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation
    in the NVLAP Health Information Technology Testing program. For more information,
    visit the NVLAP website.
