abstract:
- content: This publication from the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education
    (NICE) describes the Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework), a
    fundamental reference for describing and sharing information about cybersecurity
    work. It expresses that work as Task statements and describes Knowledge and Skill
    statements that provide a foundation for learners including students, job seekers,
    and employees. The use of these statements helps students to develop skills, job
    seekers to demonstrate competencies, and employees to accomplish tasks. As a common,
    consistent lexicon that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work, the NICE
    Framework improves communication about how to identify, recruit, develop, and
    retain cybersecurity talent. The NICE Framework is a reference source from which
    organizations or sectors can develop additional publications or tools that meet
    their needs to define or provide guidance on different aspects of cybersecurity
    education, training, and workforce development.
