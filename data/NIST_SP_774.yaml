abstract:
- content: The document presents information on 132 private sector groups in the United
    States which engage in product certification activities. Entries describe the
    type and purpose of each organization, the nature of the activity, products certified,
    standards used, certification requirements, any accreditation or recognition by
    a U.S. or foreign private sector or government agency, availability of services,
    methods of cost determination, and other relevant details. The directory is part
    of an ongoing NIST (formerly NBS) effort to establish and maintain comprehensive
    information on standards, regulations, certification programs and related topics.
