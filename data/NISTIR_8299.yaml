abstract:
- content: Since 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security has provided over $1 6
    billion dollars in grant assistance to secure cities and non-profit organizations
    against terrorist and disaster incidents. In order to meet the threat demands,
    public safety organizations have increasingly invested in video surveillance systems
    to increase their patrol footprint and monitor major transportation areas. Many
    cities now have hundreds to thousands of public safety and transportation infrastructure
    cameras; larger cities have tens of thousands of these cameras. Public safety
    now faces a growing diversity of video data sources, and these volumes of data
    are increasingly vital to public safety operations. However, analysis of video
    data to support real-time operations largely relies on manual processes and non-security
    related, impractical physically isolated architectures. The purpose of this publication
    is to chart a path forward to guide public safety related agencies and individual
    public safety departments in their transition from a state of interoperability
    that occurs by chance to a state of institutionalized interoperability which incorporates
    the next-generation of video analytics through measured steps and broad stakeholder
    informed decision making.
