abstract:
- content: On April 3-6, 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) hosted the Model- Based Enterprise (MBE) Summit to identify challenges,
    research, implementation issues, and les- sons learned in manufacturing and quality
    assurance where a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as
    the authoritative information source for all activities in the product's lifecycle.
    The MBE Summit was co-sponsored by NIST, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD),
    and ASME. The 2017 theme was Normalizing the Model-Based Enterprise. For the first
    time, there was an MBE 101 session for attendees interested in learning about
    Model-Based Enterprise and the benefits MBE may bring to their companies. This
    report is a summary of the proceedings of the 2017 MBE Summit.
