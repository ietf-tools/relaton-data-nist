abstract:
- content: Albatross (Family Diomedeidae) are long-lived seabirds that inhabit most
    of the world's oceans coming ashore only to breed. Most of the species are listed
    as at least vulnerable by the IUCN and have been tracked during breeding and non-breeding
    seasons. This review set against Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epic poem The Rime
    of the Ancient Mariner examines the current threats to albatross including fisheries,
    plastic ingestion, oil pollution, climate change, and chemical contamination while
    demonstrating how albatross may serve as a biomonitor for the state of our oceans.
