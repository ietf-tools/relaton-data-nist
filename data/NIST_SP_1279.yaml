abstract:
- content: 'Wastewater surveillance is a promising approach to monitor biological
    and chemical contaminants on a community level in support of public health and
    safety decisions. Wastewater surveillance has recently been shown highly effective
    for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks within specific populations such
    as communities or buildings. As such, significant advances have been made in wastewater
    surveillance since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, many challenges
    remain to be addressed to establish an enduring capability for wastewater surveillance
    poised to respond to new targets as they emerge. The Standards for an Enduring
    Capability in Wastewater Surveillance for Public Health Workshop, co-sponsored
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Department of Homeland
    Security, aimed to identify these challenges and identify potential standards-based
    solutions to address them. This free, three-day, virtual workshop convened over
    500 participants representing over 20 countries who are involved in all aspects
    of wastewater surveillance from sampling and testing methods to results/reporting
    and use of data, and represented organizations including government, public health,
    testing and manufacturing, academia, and non-profits. The presentations, panel
    discussions, and polling led to the emergence of three themes for standards for
    wastewater surveillance: concordance without constraints, nationally consistent,
    and building for the next pandemic.'
