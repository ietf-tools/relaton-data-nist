abstract:
- content: Fuel and motor oil quality programs are implemented to provide an official
    presence in the marketplace to verify that sellers of engine fuels and motor oils
    have control systems in place to ensure the products they sell conform to the
    quality specifications in federal and state laws and regulations. Routine, unannounced
    verification of fuel and motor oil quality enables the programs to identify sellers
    and their suppliers who have quality control systems in place and to focus enforcement
    resources on those who do not. This handbook outlines how samples are to be taken,
    identified, protected and transported to a laboratory for testing. It also provides
    information on safety and sampling equipment and includes illustrations of the
    equipment or forms described in the text.
