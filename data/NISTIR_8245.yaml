abstract:
- content: The public safety community has a unique opportunity to improve communication
    technology for incident response with the creation of the national public safety
    broadband network (NPSBN). Understanding the problems currently being experienced
    by first responders with communication technology as well as first responders?
    communication technology requests provides the basis for addressing and developing
    solutions to improve public safety communication. The National Institute of Standards
    Public Safety Communications Research usability team has conducted in-depth interviews
    with approximately 200 first responders representing 13 states in eight Federal
    Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regions. The population sample includes urban,
    suburban, and rural locations, and various levels in the chain of command within
    the fire, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and communications center
    disciplines. This report is the second in a series of reports documenting the
    findings. A qualitative analysis of the transcribed interview data revealed thousands
    of problems currently being experienced by first responders and new functionality
    requests. Further analysis, with respect to current problems identified 25 distinct
    categories, with 1 729 quotes categorized across the four domains. The new functionality
    request data analysis resulted in 1 143 categorized quotes belonging to 18 categories.
    While overlap exists across disciplines for the majority of problems and requests,
    three major themes across the public safety landscape were identified in addition
    to discipline-specific topics that need to be addressed as future communication
    technology for first responders develops.
