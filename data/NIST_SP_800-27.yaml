abstract:
- content: The Engineering Principles for Information Technology (IT) Security (EP-ITS)
    presents a list of system-level security principles to be considered in the design,
    development, and operation of an information system. Ideally, the principles presented
    here would be used from the onset of a program⁰₄at the beginning of, or during
    the design phase⁰₄and then employed throughout the system⁰₉s life-cycle. However,
    these principles are also helpful in affirming and confirming the security posture
    of already deployed information systems. The principles are short and concise
    and can be used by organizations to develop their system life-cycle policies.
