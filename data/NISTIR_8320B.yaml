abstract:
- content: In today's cloud data centers and edge computing, attack surfaces have
    significantly increased, cyber attacks are industrialized, and most security control
    implementations are not coherent or consistent. The foundation of any data center
    or edge computing security strategy should be securing the platform on which data
    and workloads will be executed and accessed. The physical platform represents
    the foundation for any layered security approach and provides the initial protections
    to help ensure that higher-layer security controls can be trusted. This report
    explains an approach based on hardware-enabled security techniques and technologies
    for safeguarding container deployments in multi-tenant cloud environments. It
    also describes a prototype implementation of the approach intended to be a blueprint
    or template for the general security community.
