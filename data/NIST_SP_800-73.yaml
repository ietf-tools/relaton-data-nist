abstract:
- content: 'SP 800-73 specifies smart card interfaces used to retrieve and use identity
    credentials. These specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability
    and PIV Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying PIV data model,
    communication interface, and application programming interface (API). Specifications
    include the PIV data model, API, and card interface requirements necessary to
    comply with the mandated use cases for interoperability across deployments or
    agencies. Interoperability is defined as the use of PIV identity credentials such
    that client APIs, compliant card applications and compliant integrated circuit
    cards can be used interchangeably by information processing systems across Federal
    agencies. SP 800-73 does not address the back-end processes that must be performed
    to attain full identity assertion. The document describes two realizations of
    the client-application programming and card command interfaces for personal identity
    verification: the transitional interfaces and the end-point interfaces. Transitional
    interfaces may be used by agencies with an existing identity card program as an
    optional step in evolving to the end-point interfaces. End-point interfaces are
    used by agencies without an existing identity card program and by agencies that
    elect to evolve to the end-point interface in one step rather than two. SP 800-73
    is divided into three parts: Part 1 provides specifications common to both the
    transitional and end-point interfaces and guidance on strategies for migrating
    from the transitional interfaces to the end-point interfaces; Part 2 describes
    the subsets of GSC-ISv2.1 that comprise the transitional interfaces to the PIV
    data model; and Part 3 describes the PIV data model''s end-point interfaces.'
