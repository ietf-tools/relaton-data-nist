abstract:
- content: A powder capture capsule has been designed to capture thin regions of powder
    at multiple heights within a powder bed of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) equipment.
    This design is stackable, support free, and allows powder capture from a targeted
    region (stacked layers) of the powder bed. Extraction is ergonomic, quick, and
    does not require any special tools; it also ensures sufficient powder for post
    analyses. An approximate apparent density of the powder bed pertaining to the
    region under investigation has also been evaluated in this test case.
