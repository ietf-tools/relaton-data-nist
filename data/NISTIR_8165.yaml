abstract:
- content: The Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE) team evaluated
    approximately 800 000 warnings from static analyzers.We learned that elements
    that we call code complexities make the detection of warnings more difficult.
    Most tools cannot not distinguish between the absence of a weakness and the presence
    of a weakness. That has been obscured in the code. This paper presents classes
    of code complexities. Understanding code complexity can assist in the development
    of coding guidelines for assuring that software is fully analyzable by static
    analyzers.
