abstract:
- content: 'This document presents a concept of operations (CONOPS) and an overview
    of an application programming interface (API) specification for the Iris Exchange
    (IREX) 10 Ongoing Evaluation of Iris Recognition, Identification Track. IREX is
    a program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), within
    the Information Technology Laboratory(ITL)/Information Access Division(IAD)/Image
    Group. IREX 10 is administered off-line in NIST s Biometrics Research Lab (BRL).
    Developers submit their matching software for testing over sequestered iris data.
    As an ongoing evaluation, developers may submit at any time unless otherwise specified
    on the IREX 10 Homepage: https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/irex-10-identification-track.'
