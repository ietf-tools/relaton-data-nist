abstract:
- content: This Telecommunication Security Guideline is intended to provide a security
    baseline for Network Elements (NEs) and Mediation Devices (MDs) that is based
    on commercial security needs. In addition, some National Security and Emergency
    Preparedness (NS/EP) security requirements will be integrated into the baseline
    to address specific network security needs. The guideline should assist telecommunications
    vendors in developing systems and service providers in implementing systems with
    appropriate security for integration into the Public Switched Network (PSN). It
    can also be used by a government agency or a commercial organization to formulate
    a specific security policy. It does not stipulate regulatory requirements or mandated
    standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
