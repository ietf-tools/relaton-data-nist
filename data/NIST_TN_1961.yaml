abstract:
- content: The public safety community is in a period of great transition. Over the
    next 20 years, technology advancements will enable data, video, and eventually
    voice communications to migrate from Land Mobile Radio (LMR) networks to a single
    nationwide Long Term Evolution (LTE) broadband network, the Nationwide Public
    Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). Emerging technologies within this new infrastructure
    present opportunities and challenges for public safety, and the process of modernizing
    responder communications requires significant coordination and planning. To facilitate
    the transition from LMR to LTE, the National Institute of Standards and Technology⁰₉s
    (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) program initiated a research
    and development (R&D) planning process to determine what technology investments
    are of highest priority to the public safety community. This document summarizes
    the results of PSCR⁰₉s Public Safety Enhanced User Interface R&D Roadmap. This
    report is the third of several technology roadmaps that PSCR has developed over
    the past several years to better inform the investment decisions of R&D organizations
    supporting the public safety community. This document aims to assist in planning
    for public safety communications research and optimize the allocation of the
