abstract:
- content: 'From 1984 to 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    coordinated the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for
    laboratories that measure fat- soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum
    and plasma. This report describes the design of and results for the Spring and
    Fall 1987 MMQAP measurement comparability improvement studies: 1) Round Robin
    IX Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum and 2) Round Robin XI Fat-Soluble
    Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum. The first participant results for Round
    Robin IX were received April 22, 1987; the last results were received June 23,
    1987. The first participant results for Round Robin XI were received July 8, 1987;
    the last results were received September 4, 1987. The analytes in Round Robin
    X were selenium and zinc and are not discussed in this report.'
