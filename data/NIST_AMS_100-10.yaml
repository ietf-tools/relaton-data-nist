abstract:
- content: 'This guide contains supplemental information for the NIST MBE PMI Validation
    and Conformance Testing Project. It is assumed that the reader has some familiarity
    with the project including the test cases and test results. The project created
    a test system to measure conformance of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software to
    American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards for product and manufacturing
    information (PMI), specifically geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T)
    information. The test system has three main components: test cases, test CAD models,
    and verification and validation test results. The verification and validation
    results measure PMI implementation capabilities in CAD software and derivative
    STEP, JT, and 3D PDF files. The information relating to the test case descriptions
    and verification results that can be used to: (1) provide insights into the test
    cases, PMI annotations, and verification testing results, and (2) inform future
    testing projects in the development of test cases and testing procedures and criteria.'
