abstract:
- content: Accurate and reliable time signals are an essential part of critical infrastructure
    systems in the United States. Because these systems often cannot function properly
    without accurate time signals, timing system failures can have serious consequences,
    with the potential implications including economic loss, reduced safety and security,
    and loss of human life. The primary time synchronization sources for these systems
    are signals broadcast by Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, which has
    understandably led to concerns about our dependency on GPS timing. This report
    provides an overview of how timing systems work and defines some basic terminology
    and specifications. It then discusses the regulatory timing requirements and GPS
    timing dependencies of United States critical infrastructure systems operating
    in the financial, telecommunications, and electric power sectors.
