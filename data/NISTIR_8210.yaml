abstract:
- content: In September 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity
    held a fingerprint data collection as part of the Nail to Nail Fingerprint Challenge.
    Participating Challengers deployed devices designed to collect an image of the
    full nail to nail surface area of a fingerprint - equivalent to a rolled fingerprint
    - from an unacclimated user without assistance from a trained device operator.
    Images captured from these devices were searched against a set of traditionally-
    captured operator-assisted rolled fingerprints. Thousands of latent fingerprints
    were also searched against the images.
