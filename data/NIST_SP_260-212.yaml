abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM) 916b Bilirubin comprises neat unconjugated
    bilirubin that is certified as a chemical substance of known purity. It is intended
    for use in the calibration and standardization of measurement procedures for the
    determination of bilirubin in clinical samples and for assignment of bilirubin
    quantity values to in-house control materials. A unit of SRM 916b consists of
    100 mg of bilirubin. This publication documents the production, analytical methods,
    and computations involved in characterizing this product.
