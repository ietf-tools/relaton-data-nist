abstract:
- content: Many older certified reference materials have certificates of analysis
    that do not fully comply with ISO Guide 31. This applies to many NIST Standard
    Reference Materials (SRM) that have published uncertainty estimates not compliant
    with the GUM or have no uncertainty estimates at all. When older certification
    records are sparse and insufficient data are available for a full, modern, statistical
    analysis, it can be useful to apply the concept of the Horwitz formula relating
    measurement uncertainty to constituent mass fraction across a population of results
    from a variety of test methods. Because the quality inherent in results obtained
    during SRM development projects is likely better than the quality of at least
    some data used by Horwitz to derive the published relationship, it is sensible
    to retune the concept, using a large set of results from NIST SRM projects. This
    approach is described with examples provided, and its utility is discussed in
    comparison to and in combination with alternative approaches such as Type A evaluation
    using Student?s t coverage intervals and a Bayesian procedure. A six step process
    is defined to tackle a variety of situations encountered with older SRMs. NIST
    is applying this approach to upgrade numerous certificates for metals, ores and
    related materials.
