abstract:
- content: Rheological measurements of suspensions are often performed using a rotational
    rheometer. In this type of rheometer, the tested fluid is sheared between two
    surfaces, one of which is rotating to generate a laminar flow of the fluid between
    the surfaces (i.e., a Couette flow). Manufacturers of commercially available rheometers
    generally recommend the use of a standard oil of known viscosity to verify that
    the rheometer is operating correctly. However, in the case of concrete rheometers,
    this approach would require large volumes of oil and was deemed not economically
    feasible by two international studies [1] [2]. The conclusion of those international
    studies was that the optimal approach to calibrate concrete rheometers would be
    to develop a non-Newtonian standard reference material (SRM) that contained inclusions
    similar in size to aggregates used commonly in concrete. This could be achieved
    by using a multi-stage approach where each stage corresponds to a different level
    of complexity of the fluid. The first stage would be to create a paste reference
    material, as was done in the SRM 2492 [3]. The second stage would be to mimic
    the mortar phase of a concrete, and SRM 2493 [4], with 1 mm beads added to SRM
    2492, accomplishes that goal. The third, and final stage, is the creation of SRM
    2497 for concrete, with larger beads added to SRM 2493, which is currently in
    development at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). During the
    certification of SRM 2493, it was found that differences in rheometer geometry
    affect the accuracy of the rheological measurements. In order to gain fundamental
    insight about the impact that different rheometer geometries have on measurements
    of suspensions, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on three different rheometer
    families. The analysis included both experimental testing and computer simulation.
    The comparison between the model and rheological results showed that the increased
    viscosity due to the addition of the 1 mm beads to SRM 2492 was significantly
    higher in the Couette model than in the experimental data. It was also determined
    that some geometries, such as a double spiral, resulted in a higher viscosity
    than a simple serrated cylinder or vane. This finding led to the inference that
    slippage should also be considered. Ultimately, this report highlights that industrial
    rheometers experience slippage issues caused by their choice of geometry and their
    internal boundary conditions (free surfaces), and discusses the most accurate
    alternative available for calibrating rheometers.
