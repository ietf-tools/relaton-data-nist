abstract:
- content: This document describes NIST’s approach to mapping the elements of documentary
    standards, regulations, frameworks, and guidelines to a particular NIST publication,
    such as CSF Subcategories or SP 800-53r5 controls. This approach is intended to
    be used to map relationships involving NIST cybersecurity and privacy publications
    that will be submitted via the NIST National Online Informative References (OLIR)
    process for hosting on NIST’s online Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool
    (CPRT). The approach will provide flexibility to capture relationships for various
    levels of concepts and in different degrees of detail in human-consumable, machine-readable
    formats. The approach is informed by concept system and terminology standards,
    as well as experience with what information the security and privacy community
    would find most valuable.
