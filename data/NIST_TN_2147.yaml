abstract:
- content: This report presents a laboratory-based characterization of Long Term Evolution
    (LTE) User Equipment (UE) emissions under closed-loop power control, building
    on our prior work (NIST TN 2069), which assessed the impact of a large number
    of factors affecting UE emissions. Specifically, this investigation aims to shed
    light on real-world UE behavior through rigorous measurements of uplink power
    per physical resource block under a variety of realistic conditions and settings.
    In addition, this work provides insight into the relationship between the UE-reported
    uplink power and the actual power radiated by the UE. Although the results presented
    here pertain to LTE equipment operating in a specific frequency band, LTE Band
    66 (1710 MHz - 1780 MHz), the measurement method is presented in enough detail
    that additional investigations can be performed in other bands of interest. The
    report concludes with a summary of contributions on a variety of uplink emissions
    topics of common interest to those developing interference models and coexistence
    strategies.
