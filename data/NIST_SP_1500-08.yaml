abstract:
- content: Correct time and timing is one of the foundational elements in enabling
    the communication and orchestration of technologies for accurate and optimal wide
    area monitoring, protection and control in the power industry. NIST and IEEE-SA
    conducted a workshop to gather inputs from stakeholders in order to identify,
    analyze, and provide guidance on technologies, standards and methodologies for
    addressing the practical challenges that are currently being experienced in wide
    area time synchronization. One of the key drivers for the workshop is the need
    to prioritize NIST efforts in addressing precision timing needs in power systems.
    NIST has established a Smart Grid Testbed, which includes the Precision Timing
    module in order to support the IEEE 1588 Power Profile efforts and to serve as
    a basis for timing measurement and security research. The objective of the workshop
    is to identify the challenges, the community of experts and potential collaborators
    as well as key research priorities to guide future efforts is for ensuring the
    integrity, availability, accuracy, and precision of timing requirements are met
    in power systems.
