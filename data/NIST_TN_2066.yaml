abstract:
- content: There is a smart grid messaging framework known as an Open Field Message
    Bus (OpenFMB), which was ratified by the North American Energy Standards Board
    (NAESB) in March 2016 and has been released as NAESB RMQ.26, Open Field Message
    Bus (OpenFMB) Model Business Practices. OpenFMB focuses on describing a publish-and-subscribe
    model of communication for smart grid devices to enable efficient communication
    of data. Subsequent analysis of OpenFMB and its possible implementations will
    focus on threat analyses of the framework, implementations, cybersecurity recommendations,
    and a proof of concept implementation of OpenFMB. The OpenFMB framework is being
    explored as a way to implement publishsubscribe communications between smart grid
    network nodes. This paper focuses on the cybersecurity risk implications of deployments
    and a proof of concept implementation of OpenFMB.
