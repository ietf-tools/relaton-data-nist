abstract:
- content: Internet of Things (IoT) is the product of the worlds of information technology
    (IT) and operational technology (OT)converging. IoT combines the ability to observe
    the physical world with distributed computing systems that can combine and analyze
    the resulting data, using the results to better inform decision making, alter
    the physical environment, and predict future events. While the basic ideas related
    to IoT are understood, a precise understanding of the IoT concept is lacking,
    with different groups (including standards development organizations, private
    companies, consortium, and even government agencies) providing varying definitions
    for IoT, which results in confusion among stakeholders. This document provides
    a foundation for IoT that can be used to encourage discussion and conversation
    around IoT. It describes several key terms and core concepts related to IoT and
    explains how those terms and concepts relate to each other. The model provides
    a common language that can be used to communicate, specify, review, analyze, and
    reason about IoT definitions, documents, architectures, components, and systems.
