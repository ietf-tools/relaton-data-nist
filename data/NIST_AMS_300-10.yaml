abstract:
- content: The purpose of this recommendations report is to provide practical how-to
    guidance for ensuring traceability and trustworthiness of manufacturing-related
    data. The recommendations contained herein address both subtractive and additive
    manufacturing processes. Commercial-solution developers, technical-assessment
    personnel, and interested end-users are the intended audience of this recommendations
    report. Guidance for deploying a system, or set of systems, for ensuring traceability
    and trustworthiness of manufacturing-related data is the scope of this recommendations
    report. Data formats conforming to selected international, open, consensus-based
    standards are in scope. Proprietary data formats are out of scope. File-based
    and data-stream representations are in scope. Data collected from computer numerical
    control subtractive fabrication processes (e.g., milling, turning) and CNC metal-forming
    additive (e.g., directed-energy deposition, powder-bed fusion) fabrication processes
    is in scope. Data collected from polymer-based additive processes, fiber-reinforced
    plastic (FRP) composite processes, and mass-conserving fabrication processes (e.g.,
    casting, forging) is out of scope.
