abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients
    Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat-soluble
    vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the
    design of and results for the Winter and Summer 2017 MMQAP measurement comparability
    improvement studies: 1) Round Robin LXXXI Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids
    in Human Serum (RR81) and 2) Round Robin LXXXII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids
    in Human Serum (RR82). To avoid increasing participation fees, the overhead costs
    for these programs were minimized by shipping the materials for both studies in
    the same package in February 2017. Participants were requested not to analyze
    the Summer samples before June 5, 2017 but to provide their measurement results
    by September 4, 2017. Participants were reminded of the due-date by e-mail in
    early August 2017.'
