abstract:
- content: To gather more in-depth information about how disasters affect businesses
    and nonprofits, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and
    the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launched a study of
    business disruption and recovery related to several recent disasters. This report
    outlines the survey instrument used as the basis for the research designed and
    conducted in partnership between Texas Sea Grant and the Texas A&M University
    Hazard Reduction and Recovery Center (HRRC), NIST Applied Economics Office (AEO),
    and the NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment (RISA) Program. This
    research protocol uses a mixed-method research approach to study businesses and
    nonprofit organizations that were impacted by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and their
    long-term recovery process. The approach combines both quantitative and qualitative
    data collection methods of in-person and telephone surveys to obtain organizational
    disruption and recovery information from organizational owners and managers.
