abstract:
- content: 'For two days beginning on March 8, 2017, a planning workshop entitled
    Electron Microscopy Frontiers: Opportunities and Challenges was hosted by the
    Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) of the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST). Grass root efforts from electron microscopists across three
    MML divisions (642, 643, and 647) and two campuses (Boulder and Gaithersburg)
    co-organized this event. The organizers (in alphabetical order) John Bonevich,
    Ann Chiaramonti Debay, Andrew Herzing, Robert Keller, and June Lau, contributed
    equally to this workshop as well as this final report. The information contained
    herein is based in part on the results of the workshop, which was attended by
    stakeholders working in the field of electron microscopy (EM), as well as non-microscopy
    experts in selected fields. This report presents the expert perspectives of the
    participants, but is not intended to be taken as prevailing opinion across the
    represented field. Ideas from a series of conversations among the organizers prior
    to, and following the workshop, are also reflected in this writing.'
