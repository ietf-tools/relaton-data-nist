abstract:
- content: This guide describes how to use the STEP File Analyzer, a software tool
    that analyzes and generates a spreadsheet or a set of CSV (comma-separated value)
    files from a STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data) file. The
    spreadsheets simplify inspecting information in the STEP file at an entity and
    attribute level. STEP files can also be checked for conformance to recommended
    practices for Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) representation, PMI
    presentation, and validation properties. The STEP File Analyzer also generates
    visualizations of PMI annotations, parts modeled with tessellated geometry, and
    finite element models. The STEP File Analyzer is developed as part of the Digital
    Thread for Smart Manufacturing project in the Engineering Laboratory's Smart Manufacturing
    Operations Planning and Control Program (SMOPAC). The software was first released
    in 2012. This guide is based on version 2.30 of the software.
