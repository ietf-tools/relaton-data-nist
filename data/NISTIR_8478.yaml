abstract:
- content: 'The CCQM_Retrospectoscope system combines a nominally complete database
    of results from Consultative Committee for the Amount of Substance: Metrology
    in Chemistry and Biology (CCQM) studies with a number of graphical tools for trying
    to make sense of the data. This system supports a diverse collection of often
    eye-opening appraisals of participation and measurement performance throughout
    the history of the CCQM activities. The appraisals include the bias, uncertainty,
    and degrees of equivalence of results submitted by individual national metrology
    or designated institutes (NMI|DIs); the relative performance of NMI|DIs, and the
    uncertainty function characteristic of entire Working Groups (WGs). The system
    is implemented in Excel using Microsoftâ€™s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
    programs. It runs on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.'
