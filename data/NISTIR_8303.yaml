abstract:
- content: Small Punch (SP) testing is a methodology that uses tiny disks (generally
    8 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm thick) to estimate mechanical properties of metallic
    materials, such as tensile properties, fracture toughness, and ductile-to-brittle
    transition temperature. Empirical correlations are typically used to infer conventional
    mechanical properties from characteristic forces and displacements obtained from
    the SP test record. At NIST in Boulder, Colorado, we recently developed experimental
    and analytical procedures for running SP tests on various materials. We conducted
    SP tests on three steels with widely different tensile and fracture properties.
    The NIST setup was successfully qualified by comparing our results on A533B steel
    to the results obtained in an international round-robin, and also by comparing
    empirical correlations between SP data and tensile properties to similar relationships
    published in the literature. We also tested specimens with different surface roughness,
    to investigate the influence of surface finish on SP test results.
