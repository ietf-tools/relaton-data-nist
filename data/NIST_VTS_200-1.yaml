abstract:
- content: This document is a Cybersecurity Framework Profile developed for voting
    equipment and information systems supporting elections. This Election Infrastructure
    Profile can be utilized by election administrators and IT professionals managing
    election infrastructure to reduce the risks associated with these systems. This
    Profile provides a voluntary, risk-based approach for managing cybersecurity activities
    and reducing cyber risk to election infrastructure. The Profile is meant to supplement
    but not replace current cybersecurity standards and industry guidelines that the
    election administrators are already leveraging.
