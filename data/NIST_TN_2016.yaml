abstract:
- content: 'This report presents descriptive statistics characterizing a set of over
    14,000 spectrograms covering the 3.5 GHz band that were recorded by a recent measurement
    campaign at two coastal locations: Point Loma, in San Diego, California and Fort
    Story, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Specifically, occupancy and vacancy statistics
    are compiled for each frequency where a primary federal incumbent system in the
    3.5 GHz band, the shipborne SPN-43 air traffic control radar, was observed. In
    addition, empirical ambient (SPN-43 absent) power density distributions are presented
    for each multiple of 10 MHz between 3430-3680 MHz. These descriptive statistics
    are potentially informative to federal regulators and potential commercial users
    of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) that permits commercial wireless
    networks to share spectrum with federal users in the 3550-3700 MHz band in the
    United States.'
