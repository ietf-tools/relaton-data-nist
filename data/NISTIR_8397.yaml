abstract:
- content: 'Executive Order (EO) 14028, Improving the Nation s Cybersecurity, 12 May
    2021, directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to recommend
    minimum standards for software testing within 60 days. This document describes
    eleven recommendations for software verification techniques as well as providing
    supplemental information about the techniques and references for further information.
    It recommends the following techniques: Threat modeling to look for design-level
    security issues Automated testing for consistency and to minimize human effort
    Static code scanning to look for top bugs Heuristic tools to look for possible
    hardcoded secrets Use of built-in checks and protections Black box test cases
    Code-based structural test cases Historical test cases Fuzzing Web app scanners,
    if applicable Address included code (libraries, packages, services) The document
    does not address the totality of software verification, but instead recommends
    techniques that are broadly applicable and form the minimum standards. The document
    was developed by NIST in consultation with the National Security Agency. Additionally,
    we received input from numerous outside organizations through papers submitted
    to a NIST workshop on the Executive Order held in early June, 2021 and discussion
    at the workshop as well as follow up with several of the submitters.'
