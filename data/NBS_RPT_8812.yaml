abstract:
- content: The experimental property differences of ortho and para hydrogen and their
    mixtures as reported in the world literature for temperatures below 300¿̐¿K are
    tabulated. Properties included are specific heat, velocity of sound, thermal conductivity,
    density, viscosity, vapor pressure, saturated liquid and saturated vapor densities,
    and latent heat of vaporization. Pertinent comments regarding the experimental
    methods employed, the pressure and temperature range of the data, and the accuracy
    of the data are included when available.
