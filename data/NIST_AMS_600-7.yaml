abstract:
- content: The report highlights the manufacturing innovation projects developed by
    the institutes and their partners across the country to combat COVID-19. Manufacturing
    USA network, comprised of federal agencies and their sponsored manufacturing innovation
    institutes, assembled and utilized the flexibility, skills and knowledge of their
    nationwide membership to address issues around domestic PPE, enhanced production
    of vaccines and treatments, rapid testing, and more in order to begin developing
    solutions. These public-private-partnerships convened members from industry, academia,
    and government enabling a rapid response to the developing needs across America
    based on their access to information and ability to deploy resources. Their relevant
    and efficient plans, along with $73M in Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
    Security (CARES) Act funds distributed through the Department of Commerce and
    Department of Defense, allowed them to execute dozens of technology development
    and education and workforce development projects.
