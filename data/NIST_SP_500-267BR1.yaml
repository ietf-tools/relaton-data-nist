abstract:
- content: This profile establishes a basic taxonomy of IPv6 capabilities, defined
    in terms of IETF specifications, resulting in specific capability labels for common
    network functions and usage scenarios. The profile maps each such labeled capability
    to one or more specific technical specifications, or parts of specifications.
    Each labeled capability adopts by reference the normative requirements of the
    cited specifications. In rare cases the profile may augment or modify the normative
    requirements of a base specification. The defined capability labels effectively
    form a vocabulary for expressing IPv6 requirements for, and documenting the IPv6
    capabilities of, specific products. It is expected that this profile, when combined
    with the USGv6 Test Program, can facilitate the efficient adoption of IPv6 technologies
    in Federal information systems.
