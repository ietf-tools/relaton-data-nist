abstract:
- content: Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) contains a method and
    the associated information requirements for quality management and risk analysis.
    FMEA is applicable to manufacturing processes and product design. Quality Information
    Framework (QIF) is a standard that covers the quality measurement and analysis
    phase within a model based enterprise (MBE) for manufacturing. An information
    model, developed in Extensible Markup Language (XML) for FMEA is described in
    this paper and is proposed to be included as a part of QIF. This paper also identifies
    key information sharing between FMEA and QIF.
