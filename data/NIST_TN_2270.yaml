abstract:
- content: This report serves to characterize the uncertainty of measurements for
    key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure the physical and network performance
    of the NIST industrial wireless dual-lift testbed. A review of the methods used
    to determine uncertainty is presented. We use the method known as the Guide to
    the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) to calculate the uncertainty
    values for each measurement. A description of the dual-lift use case and the KPIs
    are presented. The resulting expanded uncertainty values are calculated for the
    KPIs, which are the positional Cartesian error between the leader and follower
    robots, and the latency of the data packets associated with the informational
    transactions of the leader and followerâ€™s control loop. It is concluded that the
    measurement systems used in the dual-lift use case have relatively small uncertainty
    values for the detection of latency perturbations in the real-time control application
    implemented on the testbed.
