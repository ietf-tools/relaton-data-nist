abstract:
- content: This report describes the experiments conducted during the first phase
    of a multi-phase project designed to assess structure-to-structure fire spread
    for structures in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI). The experiments focused
    on quantifying thermal exposures from auxiliary structures, e.g., sheds. The effects
    of shed sizes, construction materials, fuel loading, and separation distance on
    the ignition of primary structures (residential dwellings) with no wind have been
    studied and reported. Preliminary structure separation experiments using natural
    gas burners and an instrumented target structure were conducted to optimize instrumentation
    and experimental design for shed burn experiments. Full-scale fire experiments
    were conducted in which various sizes and types of sheds were used to generate
    typical radiative and convective heat exposures. Experiments were conducted indoors
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to quantify exposures
    from small source structures (sheds) in terms of mass loss rate (MLR) and heat
    release rate (HRR). HRR was measured using oxygen consumption calorimetry. Large
    and very large sheds were tested outdoors at the Insurance Institute for Business
    & Home Safety (IBHS) test facility. The mass loss method was employed to estimate
    the HRR for the outdoor shed burns. In addition, indoor shed burn experiments
    with a target structure were conducted to assess target performance against exposures
    from varying sheds (construction, size, fuel loading) and separation distances.
    All experiments were performed without an artificially generated wind field. The
    preliminary experiments helped troubleshoot and provided insights into the airflow
    bias effects within the indoor test facility. The indoor shed burn experiments
    demonstrated that the mass loss measurements can be used to infer HRR measurements.
    The peak HRR (PHRR) was a function of construction materials, shed size, and fuel
    loading. Heat fluxes were measured and the effects of the burning shed on the
    target structure were documented under no-wind conditions as a function of separation
    distance, construction materials, shed size, fuel loading, and shed openings.
    The mass loss method was used to infer HRR for from very large auxiliary structures
    tested outdoors at the IBHS test facility. Generally, for a given shed size and
    fuel loading, the PHRR, which is related to the fire hazard, depended on the shed
    construction material. Combustible shed source structures generated a greater
    PHRR than non-combustible sheds, almost by a factor of 4. The exposures quantified
    in this study demonstrate that any auxiliary structures made from combustible
    materials can pose a significant fire hazard when placed next to the primary structure.
    For non-combustible source structures, the shed orientation with respect to the
    primary structure and the size of the door opening are critical factors. Sheds
    and auxiliary structures exceeding 120 ft2 floor area are subject to placement
    requirements with respect to residential structure(s) on the same lot through
    Chapter 7A of the California Building Code. The location and spacing of smaller
    sheds (e.g., under 120 ft2) may or may not be regulated and current codes often
    allow these smaller sheds to be as close as 5 ft from a residence or property
    line. The findings from this study can provide technical input for national, state,
    and local building codes to alleviate fire spread from auxiliary structures within
    WUI communities.
