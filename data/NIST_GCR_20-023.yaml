abstract:
- content: 'The critical path method (CPM) is investigated as a tool for identifying
    recovery activities that control the timeline for restoration of key community
    functions in the wake of a major disruptive event, such as a hurricane or tornado.
    Three recovery endpoints are studied: (1) restoring drinking water systems to
    normal operations, (2) returning children to school, and (3) returning businesses
    to normal operations. Interviews were conducted with individuals in seven communities
    who led recovery efforts between 2011 and 2019. The primary goal was to identify
    and document the sequence and duration of activities that would have delayed key
    recovery milestones if they had started later or taken longer to complete. Within
    each function, intermediate milestones are also identified, for example, students
    returning to school in temporary modules or the partial reopening of a business.
    Master tables for water, schools, and business are developed that summarize the
    activities on the critical paths identified in each community. Several opportunities
    to speed up the recovery process are identified, and issues relevant to the modeling
    of community recovery are discussed.'
