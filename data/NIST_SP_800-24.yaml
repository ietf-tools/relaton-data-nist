abstract:
- content: 'This report presents a generic methodology for conducting an analysis
    of a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) in order to identify security vulnerabilities.
    The report focuses on digital-based PBXs and addresses the following areas for
    study: System Architecture; Hardware; Maintenance; Administrative Database/Software;
    and User Features. The methods described in this report are designed to assist
    administrators in conducting this type of testing. Computer based telephony systems
    and new techniques such as voice over IP (VOIP) present an entirely new collection
    of vulnerabilities and are not addressed in this report. However, some of the
    evaluation methods described here may be applied to these systems as well.'
