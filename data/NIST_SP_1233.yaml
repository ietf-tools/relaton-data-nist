abstract:
- content: In response to needs of a government-wide initiative in nanotechnology
    led by a subcommittee within the White House s Office of Science and Technology
    Policy, NIST established a nanotechnology environmental, health, and safety (nano-EHS)
    research program in 2009 that remained active through 2016. This document summarizes
    the NIST Nano-EHS Program goals, projects, outputs, and impacts. The program was
    designed to address, in collaboration with other agencies, the research needs
    for a comprehensive U.S. measurement infrastructure for nano-EHS as identified
    by federal agencies participating in the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Such
    an infrastructure included a suite of measurement tools methods, protocols, standards
    (reference materials and documentary), instruments, models, and benchmark (validated)
    data. The NIST Nano-EHS Program made substantial progress in developing the required
    infrastructure, producing 9 reference materials, 24 web-accessible protocols,
    and 212 archival journal articles, 59% of which have been published in journals
    with impact factors greater than 3. In addition, program team members held leadership
    positions in the nanotechnology committees of major standards development organizations
    and led and contributed to the development of standards in these committees.
