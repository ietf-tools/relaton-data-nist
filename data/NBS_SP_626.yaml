abstract:
- content: Members of the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Group of the International
    Committee for Radionuclide Metrology agreed in 1979 to collect the nuclear data
    from any measurements in their laboratories that were pertinent to the calibration
    of the efficiency of germanium spectrometer systems. This report is composed of
    the contributions from 14 laboratories, as listed in part II. If a self-contained
    contribution was received, it has been incorporated without editing. Less formal
    communications, or references to published articles, are discussed in short comments
    prepared by the compilers. Part IV is a compilation of a selected portion of the
    data, arranged by radionuclide.
