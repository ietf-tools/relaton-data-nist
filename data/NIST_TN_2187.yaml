abstract:
- content: The Time and Frequency Division of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce (DOC),
    was tasked with fulfilling Section 4, Part (i) of the Position, Navigation and
    Timing (PNT) Executive Order that was signed by the President on February 12,
    2020. The Executive Order states that Within 180 days of the date of this order,
    the Secretary of Commerce shall make available a GNSS-independent source of Coordinated
    Universal Time, to support the needs of critical infrastructure owners and operators,
    for the public and private sectors to access. Although the Executive Order does
    not specifically provide an accuracy requirement, this report assumes an accuracy
    requirement of 1 ?s with respect to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This specification
    is assumed because numerous critical infrastructure timing systems in the United
    States are now heavily dependent on signals received from the Global Positioning
    System (GPS) satellites that routinely provide sub-microsecond accuracy, and other
    UTC sources that deliver time at comparable accuracy levels are needed to alleviate
    or reduce these dependencies. This report was written to describe, propose, and
    recommend technical methods that NIST has already implemented, or can potentially
    implement, to fulfill Section 4, Part (i) of the PNT Executive Order.
