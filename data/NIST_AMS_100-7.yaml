abstract:
- content: The Symposium on Data Analytics for Advanced Manufacturing was held in
    conjunction with the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data in Washington
    D.C. on December 6-7, 2016. The Symposium's goal was to address manufacturing
    industries' issues, needs, and challenges related to data analytics solutions
    for advanced manufacturing. The Symposium was themed From Sensing to Decision-Making.
    The Symposium brought industry, government, and academic organizations together
    to exchange ideas and provide a common platform to build partnerships. This report
    summarizes the keynote presentations, technical paper presentations, and panel
    discussion of this symposium. The Symposium also hosted a manufacturing data challenge,
    which is summarized in this report. This report also elicits the lessons learned
    from this symposium, and presents action items for future research on data analytics
    for advanced manufacturing.
