abstract:
- content: Achieving the vision of 'smart manufacturing' and 'Industrie 4.0' requires
    building on successes in computational control of processes to create generic
    approaches for management of manufacturing operations, or smart manufacturing
    operations management (SMOM). The approach to SMOM presented in this report generalizes
    the modeling framework of ISA-95 with a reference model for discrete event logistics
    systems (DELS) that identifes fve generic operations management decisions. This
    report applies it in a computational model of a large-scale, highly-automated
    central fll pharmacy that is the basis for a simulation testbed enabling convenient
    experimentation with operations management policies and decision algorithms.
