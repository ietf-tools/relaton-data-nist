abstract:
- content: Elimination of particulate from fire exhaust streams is a common issue
    for fire labs. Two series of fire experiments were conducted in the National Fire
    Research Laboratory (NFRL) to test technologies for possible use in the filtration
    of soot from the Building 224 fire research exhaust. The first experimental series
    used two large surface area pleated cartridge filters to capture particulate in
    the gas phase. The second series of experiments employed a wet scrubbing system.
    The experiments showed that neither technology provides adequate performance.
    The results showed that the first system rapidly clogged and the pressure drop
    across the filters did not efficiently recover to its pre-test value when pulsed.
    The particulate removal efficiency of the wet scrubbing soot filtration system
    was inadequate.
