abstract:
- content: The outer shell of the jacket and pants of a firefighter's protective clothing
    is constructed of a fabric that is commonly a blend of polyaramid, polybenzimidazole,
    and/or poly(melamine-formaldehyde) fibers. The outer shell contributes to the
    thermal and moisture protection of the garment, but its primary purpose is to
    provide protection from other physical hazards, such as sharp objects and abrasive
    surfaces. The research discussed in this manuscript indicates that the mechanical
    performance, which is critical to the outer shell providing protection against
    these physical hazards, of polyaramid and polybenzimidazole based outer shell
    fabrics will rapidly deteriorate when exposed to simulated ultraviolet sunlight
    at 50 degree C and 50 % relative humidity. For example, these fabrics lost as
    high as 80 % of their tear and tensile strength after only 13 days of exposure
    to these conditions. In addition, a water repellant coating on these fabrics was
    significantly degraded as a result of these conditions. Even though these exposure
    conditions caused catastrophic mechanical failure, the amount of ultraviolet light
    transmitted through these fabrics was quite low. More specifically, after 13 days
    exposure these fabrics blocked more than 94 % of the ultraviolet light (Ultraviolet
    Protection Factor of 18). Using a conversion factor (defined in the manuscript),
    these outer shell fabrics will lose a high as 80 % of its mechanical performance,
    but still block at least 94 % of the sunlight after being in service for 6.3 years.
