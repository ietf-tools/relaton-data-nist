abstract:
- content: 'This document is an assessment of the current scientific foundations of
    digital forensics. We examined descriptions of digital investigation techniques
    from peer-reviewed sources, academic and classroom materials, technical guidance
    from professional organizations, and independently published sources. Digital
    investigation techniques are based on established computer science methods and
    when used appropriately are considered reliable. The process of evaluating, for
    example, the contents of a computer hard drive does not create information that
    was not there before the investigation started. However, because the field is
    rapidly changing, there are limitations that practitioners and stakeholders need
    to be aware of: (1) as with any crime scene not all evidence may be discovered;
    (2) when recovering deleted files, the results may include extraneous material;
    (3) examiners need to understand that as software (operating systems and applications)
    is revised the meaning and significance of digital artifacts created by different
    versions of the software can be different. In addition, because there are often
    multiple ways to search for information, two examiners may find different subsets
    of all potentially relevant information. The methods used in digital investigations
    are often not peer-reviewed in a formal process, but trustworthiness is established
    by members of the digital forensic community trying out proposed methods, testing,
    and circulating updates within the community. This process strengthens an examiner
    s awareness of the capabilities and limitations of their techniques.'
