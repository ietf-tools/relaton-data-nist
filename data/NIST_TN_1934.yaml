abstract:
- content: Cement-based materials (e.g. cement paste, mortar and concrete) are complex
    rheological fluids that display time-dependent and shear-dependent rheological
    behavior. Over the years, various concrete rheometers have been proposed and made
    available commercially; however, there is no method to calibrate them. Furthermore,
    typical calibration fluids used in commercial rheometers are not well suited for
    the concrete rheometer calibration due to their high cost and they are Newtonian
    (i.e., not a complex fluid). Therefore, there was a clear need for a reference
    material specifically designed for concentrated, granular suspensions, such as
    cement paste, mortar and concrete; this need led to the development of a new series
    of reference materials for calibration of devices used in cement-based suspension
    rheological testing. The reference material to simulate cement paste, SRM 2492,
    was composed of a fine limestone powder in a corn syrup matrix. While the ranking
    of mixtures tested using these rheometers tend to match, the absolute values for
    the rheological properties of the mixtures evaluated with different rheometers
    are not well correlated [1, 2]. Additionally, due to microbial growth in the paste
    matrix, the shelf life of standard reference material 2492 was limited to 7 d.
    This paper presents the results of a study to analyze how to minimize microbial
    growth within the paste matrix. Various biocides that extend the shelf-life of
    the reference material were examined, with the most promising method being sodium
    propionate, a non-toxic chemical. Furthermore, recommendations to improve the
    storage of SRM are provided to extend the usable shelf life.
