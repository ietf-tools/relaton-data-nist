abstract:
- content: Large outdoor fires present a risk to the built environment. In this workshop,
    presentations highlighted large outdoor fires throughout the world, and explored
    common characteristics between these fires. Specifically, each presentation provided
    an overview of the large outdoor fire risk to the built environment from each
    region, and highlighted critical research needs for this problem in the context
    of fire safety science. The workshop seeks to develop the foundation for an international
    research needs roadmap to reduce the risk of large outdoor fires to the built
    environment. This workshop also provided a forum for next generation researchers
    to contribute to this important topic.
