abstract:
- content: 'Underlying Technical Models for Information Technology Security provides
    a description of the technical foundations, termed models, that underlie secure
    information technology (IT). The intent is to provide, in a concise form, the
    models that should be considered in the design and development of technical security
    capabilities. These models encompass lessons learned, good practices, and specific
    technical considerations.The intended audience consists of both government and
    private sectors including: IT users desiring a better understanding of system
    security; engineers and architects designing/building security capabilities; and
    those developing guidance for others to use in implementing security capabilities.'
