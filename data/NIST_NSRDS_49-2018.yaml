abstract:
- content: The CYCLE_D package simulates vapor compression refrigeration cycles that
    use pure refrigerants or blends of refrigerants. The model can simulate a basic
    subcritical or transcritical refrigeration cycle, both with or without a liquid-line/suction-line
    heat exchanger. In addition, the model can simulate a subcritical two-stage economizer
    cycle, a subcritical three- stage economizer cycle, and a subcritical two-stage
    compression cycle with intercooling. Calculations are based on refrigerant properties
    as represented in the NIST Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties
    Program - REFPROP, Version 10.0. Simulation results are presented in terms of
    coefficient of performance (COP), volumetric capacity, thermodynamic parameters,
    and thermodynamic charts.
