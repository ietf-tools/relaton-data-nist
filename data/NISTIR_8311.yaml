abstract:
- content: This is the first of a series of reports on the performance of face recognition
    algorithms on faces occluded by masks, run under the Ongoing Face Recognition
    Vendor Test (FRVT) executed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST). This report documents accuracy of algorithms to recognize persons wearing
    face masks. The algorithms tested were one-to-one algorithms submitted to the
    FRVT 1:1 Verification track.
