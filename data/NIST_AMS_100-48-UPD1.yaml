abstract:
- content: Currently, global economies are using and contaminating resources faster
    than they can be regenerated. This resource depletion strains the economy and
    society today and into the future and is largely due to a series of misaligned
    incentives. Solving this problem begins by identifying these misalignments, identifying
    feasible solutions that realign incentives or addresses the results of the misalignment.
    This report examines the economics of a circular economy, focusing more on issues
    related to standards and technologies which might facilitate increased environmental
    sustainability.
