abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a public
    standardization process to select one or more schemes that provide Authenticated
    Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) and optional hashing functionalities and
    are suitable for constrained environments. In February 2019, 57 candidates were
    submitted to NIST for consideration. Among these, 56 were accepted as first-round
    candidates in April 2019. After four months, NIST selected 32 of the candidates
    for the second round. In March 2021, NIST announced 10 finalists – namely ASCON,
    Elephant, GIFT-COFB, Grain-128AEAD, ISAP, PHOTON-Beetle, Romulus, SPARKLE, TinyJAMBU,
    and Xoodyak – to move forward to the final round of the selection process. On
    February 7, 2023, NIST announced the decision to standardize the ASCON family
    for lightweight cryptography applications. This report describes the evaluation
    criteria and selection process, which is based on public feedback and internal
    review of the finalists.
