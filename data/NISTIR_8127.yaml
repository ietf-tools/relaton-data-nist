abstract:
- content: The goal of this paper is to understand how quality information characterizing
    the manufactured parts can be reported in a XML standardized format. The Quality
    Information Framework (QIF) is an ANSI standard sponsored by the Dimensional Metrology
    Standards Consortium (DMSC) that defines an integrated set of XML information
    models to enable the effective exchange of metrology data throughout the entire
    manufacturing quality measurement process - from product design to inspection
    planning to execution to analysis and reporting. The desire is that QIF will help
    foster a pervasive digital thread throughout the product lifecycle contributing
    to feedforward and feedback flow of quality information. The hope is that widespread
    adoption of QIF will lead to better and more optimized part design and manufacturing
    processes performance.
