abstract:
- content: This paper presents a simple correlation containing nine dimensionless
    parameters to predict the local convective boiling heat transfer within a micro-fin
    tube that was developed from a dataset that included a wide range of refrigerants,
    flow conditions, and hydraulic diameters. Flow boiling measurements from 36 studies
    were gathered to produce a dataset containing 29 refrigerants and 15 different
    hydraulic diameters ranging from 1.8 mm to 6.7 mm. The database was adjusted so
    that the definition of the Nusselt number, the Reynolds number, the heat flux,
    and heat transfer coefficient were all defined in the same way for each study.
    In addition, values for the most recent fluid properties were used for the calculation
    of dimensionless parameters that were used in the new correlation. The new correlation
    for micro-fin convective boiling predicted the measurements from the database
    to within 10.3 % for pure-refrigerants and azeotropic mixtures and 12.3 % for
    zeotropic mixtures.
