abstract:
- content: This publication seeks to assist organizations in understanding the risks
    of RFID technology and security measures to mitigate those risks. It provides
    practical, real-world advice on how to initiate, design, implement and operate
    RFID systems in a manner that mitigates security and privacy risks. The document
    also provides background information on RFID applications, standards, and system
    components to assist in the understanding of RFID security risks and controls.
    This document presents information that is independent of particular hardware
    platforms, operating systems, and applications. The emphasis is on RFID systems
    that are based on industry and international standards, although the existence
    of proprietary approaches is noted when they offer relevant security features
    not found in current standards.
