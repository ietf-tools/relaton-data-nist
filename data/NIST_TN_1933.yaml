abstract:
- content: Achieving national goals of net zero energy buildings requires substantial
    reduction in the energy consumption of commercial building systems. In 2015, commercial
    buildings consumed 18 % of the total energy consumed in the U.S. [1]. Although
    significant progress has been made in the integration of building control systems
    through the development of standard communication protocols, such as BACnet and
    BACnet/IP, little progress has been made in making them intelligent about optimizing
    building system-level performance. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate
    the potential for distributed, intelligent software agents to perform this optimization
    and to develop a research infrastructure suitable for development and testing
    of advanced agent-based optimization techniques that can improve the energy and
    comfort performance of building systems. Towards that goal, the Intelligent Building
    Agents Laboratory (IBAL) has been constructed to act as a testbed for these intelligent
    control algorithms. This note describes the design of a portion of that facility.
