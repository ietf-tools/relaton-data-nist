abstract:
- content: The report provides a detailed assessment of the capabilities, limitations,
    and requirements of the National Nonionizing Radiation Measurement System. The
    priorities of these measurement requirements are assessed according to their ability
    to contribute (1) to the core competence of determining the electric and magnetic
    fields of a source or (2) to the associated capabilities for (a) generating and
    applying reference fields, (b) characterizing sources and reflectors, or (c) recording
    exposure histories. The report examines these measurement capabilities at all
    frequencies between dc and 300 GHz.
