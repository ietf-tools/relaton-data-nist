abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of
    selecting one or more public-key cryptographic algorithms through a public, competition-like
    process. The new public-key cryptography standards will specify one or more additional
    digital signatures, public-key encryption, and key-establishment algorithms to
    augment FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), as well as NIST Special
    Publication SP 800-56A, Revision 3, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment
    Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography, and SP 800-56B, Revision 2, Recommendation
    for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Using Integer Factorization Cryptography. It is
    intended that these algorithms will be capable of protecting sensitive information
    well into the foreseeable future, including after the advent of quantum computers.
    The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process began in 2017 with
    69 candidate algorithms that met both the minimum acceptance criteria and submission
    requirements. The first round lasted until January 2019, during which candidate
    algorithms were evaluated based on their security, performance, and other characteristics.
    NIST selected 26 algorithms to advance to the second round for more analysis.
    This report describes the evaluation and selection process, based on public feedback
    and internal review, of the second-round candidates. The report summarizes the
    26 second-round candidate algorithms and identifies the ones selected to move
    forward to the third round of the competition. The third-round finalist public-key
    encryption and key-establishment algorithms are Classic McEliece, CRYSTALS-KYBER,
    NTRU, and SABER. The third-round finalists for digital signatures are CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM,
    FALCON, and Rainbow. These finalists will be considered for standardization at
    the end of the third round. In addition, eight alternate candidate algorithms
    will also advance to the third round: BIKE, FrodoKEM, HQC, NTRU Prime, SIKE, GeMSS,
    Picnic, and SPHINCS+'
