abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology has constructed a testbed
    to measure the performance impact of cybersecurity technologies on Industrial
    Control Systems (ICS). The testbed was chosen to support the implementation of
    the Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile: a voluntary, risk-based approach
    for managing cybersecurity activities and reducing cyber risk to manufacturing
    systems. This report focuses on the Collaborative Robotics System, one of the
    two manufacturing systems within the testbed. A methodology for implementation
    of technical solutions to meet the Profile language is described, as well as a
    comprehensive review of the testbed measurement systems, and the comparative analysis
    procedures used for identifying performance impacts. Finally, an example comparative
    analysis is performed and the characterization of the workcell is discussed.'
