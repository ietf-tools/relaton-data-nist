abstract:
- content: The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifies a FIPS-approved cryptographic
    algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES algorithm is a
    symmetric block cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information.
    Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext; decrypting
    the ciphertext converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext.
    The AES algorithm is capable of using cryptographic keys of 128, 192, and 256
    bits to encrypt and decrypt data in blocks of 128 bits.
