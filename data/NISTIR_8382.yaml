abstract:
- content: NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ 2) is open source software that links
    image quality of optical and ink 500 pixel per inch fingerprints to operational
    recognition performance. This allows quality values to be tightly defined and
    then numerically calibrated, which in turn allows for the standardization needed
    to support a worldwide deployment of fingerprint sensors with universally interpretable
    image qualities. NFIQ 2 quality features are formally standardized as part of
    ISO/IEC 29794-4 and serve as the reference implementation of the standard.
