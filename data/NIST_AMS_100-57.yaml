abstract:
- content: 'Mobile manipulators, which are robotic systems integrating an automatic
    or autonomous mobile base with a manipulator, can potentially enhance automation
    in many industrial and unstructured environments. Namely, large-scale manufacturing
    processes, typical in the aerospace, energy, transportation, and conformal additive
    manufacturing fields, encompass a notable subset of potential future mobile manipulator
    use-cases. Utilizing autonomous mobility for manipulator re-positioning could
    allow for continuous simultaneous arm and mobile base cooperation, which is referred
    to as continuous performance. Continuous mobile manipulator capabilities may hold
    particular benefit for large, curved, and complex workpieces. However, such flexibility
    can also introduce additional sources of performance uncertainty, preventing mobile
    manipulators from satisfying stringent pose repeatability and accuracy requirements.
    To identify and quantify this uncertainty, the Configurable Mobile Manipulator
    Apparatus was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
    Previous test implementations with the apparatus included non-continuous mobile
    manipulator performance, such as static and indexed performance, but continuous
    performance measurement had been demonstrated previously only in simulation and
    on proof-of-concept hardware. The work presented in this report details the transfer
    of the latest version of simulations and algorithms for continuous registration
    to an industrial mobile manipulator platform. Additionally, a 2^3 factorial designed
    experiment was conducted to produce an accompanied continuous mobile manipulator
    performance dataset. Analysis of the dataset focused on comparing the performance
    and robustness of two continuous localization methods: 1) a deterministic spiral
    search and 2) a stochastic Unscented Kalman Filter search across two selected
    mobile base speeds and sides of the apparatus.'
