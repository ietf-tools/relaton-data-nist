abstract:
- content: This publication describes the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NWF),
    the product of many years of collaboration regarding workforce training and education.
    The NWF, as a working document, provides a fundamental reference resource for
    describing and sharing information about cybersecurity work roles andthe knowledge,
    skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed to complete tasks in those work roles. As
    a common, consistent lexicon that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work,
    the NWF improves communication about how to identify, recruit, develop, and retain
    cybersecurity talent. The NWF is a reference source from which organizations or
    sectors can develop additional publications or tools focused on defining or providing
    guidance on aspects of workforce development, planning, training, and education.
