abstract:
- content: 'Cryptography is often used in an information technology security environment
    to protect data that is sensitive, has a high value, or is vulnerable to unauthorized
    disclosure or undetected modification during transmission or while in storage.
    Cryptography relies upon two basic components: an algorithm (or cryptographic
    methodology) and a cryptographic key. This Recommendation discusses the generation
    of the keys to be managed and used by the approved cryptographic algorithms.'
