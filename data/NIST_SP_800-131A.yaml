abstract:
- content: At the start of the 21st century, the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) began the task of providing cryptographic key management guidance,
    which includes defining and implementing appropriate key management procedures,
    using algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information, and planning ahead
    for possible changes in the use of cryptography because of algorithm breaks or
    the availability of more powerful computing techniques. NIST Special Publication
    (SP) 800-57, Part 1 was the first document produced in this effort, and includes
    a general approach for transitioning from one algorithm or key length to another.
    This Recommendation (SP 800-131A) provides more specific guidance for transitions
    to the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms.
