abstract:
- content: 'A gas-phase chemical kinetic model for the combustion of C1-C3 fluorine-containing
    refrigerants is presented, including a list of relevant species, their thermodynamic
    and transport properties, and the Arrhenius parameters for their reactions. Also
    included are tables of available experimental data in the literature for the laminar
    burning velocities for these HFC refrigerants and their mixtures. A comparison
    is made between the experimental data and predicted burning velocities as a function
    of the fuel-air equivalence ratio for the refrigerants. The model has been developed
    for the refrigerants: R-32, R-125, R-134a, R-152a, R-143, R-143a, R-1234yf, R-1234ze(E),
    R-1243zf and their mixtures. Agreement between predicted and measured burning
    velocity is very good for most of the refrigerant mixtures, and reasonably good
    agreement for a few.'
