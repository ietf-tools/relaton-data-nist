abstract:
- content: Approximate matching is a promising technology for designed to identify
    similarities between two digital artifacts. It is used to find objects that resemble
    each other or to find objects that are contained in another object. This can be
    very useful for filtering data for security monitoring, digital forensics, or
    other applications.
