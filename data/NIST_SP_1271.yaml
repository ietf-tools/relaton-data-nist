abstract:
- content: This document intends to provide direction and guidance to those organizations
    in any sector or community seeking to improve cybersecurity risk management via
    utilization of the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
    (Cybersecurity Framework or the Framework). Cybersecurity is an important and
    amplifying component of an organization s overall risk management process. The
    Framework enables organizations regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk,
    or cybersecurity sophistication to apply the principles and best practices of
    risk management to improve security and resilience. Through implementation of
    the Framework, organizations can better identify, assess, and manage their cybersecurity
    risks in the context of their broader mission and business objectives.
