abstract:
- content: We describe preliminary models for the viscosity, thermal conductivity,
    and surface tension for pure fluids that are constituents of four surrogate fuels
    for ultralow-sulfur diesel fuels developed under the auspices of the Coordinating
    Research Council (CRC). These fluids do not presently have published reference
    fluid quality models in the open literature, so we provide here preliminary models
    based on available data as an interim measure to allow calculations of these properties
    for both the pure fluids and the four surrogate mixtures. Comparisons with selected
    experimental pure fluid data are given, and text files compatible with the NIST
    REFPROP computer program are included as supplementary material. We also present
    tabulations of the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension along
    the bubble point for four surrogate fuels.
