abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 150-17 presents the technical requirements and guidance for
    the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
    Program (NVLAP) Cryptographic and Security Testing program. It is intended for
    information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation,
    laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing
    information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2020
    edition of NIST Handbook 150-17 incorporates changes includes a new accreditation
    scope for Automated Cryptographic Validation Testing, and updates to existing
    testing programs are included in this handbook, as well as editorial improvements.
    The requirements of NIST Handbook 150 and the specific requirements and interpretations
    in NIST Handbook 150-17 must be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation
    in the NVLAP Cryptographic and Security Testing program. For more information,
    visit the NVLAP website, .
