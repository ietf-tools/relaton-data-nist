abstract:
- content: This report presents the results of compartment fire experiments on four
    12.8 m long composite floor beams with various end support conditions. Each specimen
    was constructed as a partially composite beam, consisting of a lightweight concrete
    slab cast on 76 mm (3 in.) deep ribbed steel decking and a W18¿̐¿35 steel beam
    acting compositely via 19 mm (3/4 in.) diameter steel headed stud anchors welded
    on the top flange. Test variables included two types of simple shear connections
    (shear-tab and welded-bolted double-angle connections) and the presence or absence
    of slab continuity over girders. Hydraulic actuators were used to apply gravity
    loads to the specimen under fire conditions. The natural gas-fueled burners were
    used to create a compartment fire with the maximum heat release rate of 4000 kW.
    This study evaluated the characteristics of the fire loading and thermal and structural
    responses of the specimens. The test results indicated that the thermal restraint
    conditions significantly affected the behavior and failure modes of the specimens
    with simple shear connections. The specimens resisted gravity loads at large vertical
    displacements near midspan (approximately a ratio of the span length over 20)
    without collapse under fire loading. Various limit states and vulnerabilities
    to fires were observed, including local buckling of the steel beams near supports,
    flexural failure (yielding of steel beams and concrete fracture near restrained
    end supports), and connection failure (weld shear or bolt shear) during heating
    and cooling which could lead to partial or total collapse of the floor system.
