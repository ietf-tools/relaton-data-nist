abstract:
- content: The Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) aims to use a top-down inversion
    methodology to quantify sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions over an urban
    domain with high spatial and temporal resolution. Analyzing the contribution of
    different source types or sectors is a fundamental step in order to achieve an
    accuracy level desired for such applications. To this end, the Weather Research
    and Forecasting model (WRF-ARW) was used along with a modified version of the
    GHG chemistry module for simulating the carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction transport
    during September and October 2013. Sectoral anthropogenic CO2 emissions were obtained
    from Hestia 2013 and from Vulcan 2002. Biogenic CO2 emissions were simulated by
    using an augmented version of the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model
    (VPRM) included in WRF-CHEM. The atmospheric model performed well in capturing
    day to day variability of the concentration. The errors were largely reduced during
    the well-mixed conditions indicating that a large share of the errors was due
    to the misrepresentation of nighttime stable conditions in the model, causing
    an overestimation of the nighttime peaks. In general, the averaged daily cycle
    was well represented by the model. In addition, 4 towers presented a slightly
    delayed collapse of the nocturnal stable boundary layer. Last, the biogenic contribution
    was important, being larger than the anthropogenic contribution for 7 out of 12
    towers during this period. In general, the anthropogenic contribution was dominated
    by the Electricity Production, 6.5 % to 39 %, Mobility, 11 % to 56 %, and Industrial
    sectors, 4.8 % to 10 %.
