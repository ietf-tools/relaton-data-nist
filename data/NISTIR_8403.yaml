abstract:
- content: The rapid development and wide application of distributed network systems
    have made network security especially access control and data privacy ever more
    important. Blockchain technology offers features such as decentralization, high
    confidence, and tamper-resistance, which are advantages to solving auditability,
    resource consumption, scalability, central authority, and trust issues all of
    which are challenges for network access control by traditional mechanisms. This
    document presents general information for blockchain access control systems from
    the views of blockchain system properties, components, functions, and supports
    for access control policy models. Considerations for implementing blockchain access
    control systems are also included.
