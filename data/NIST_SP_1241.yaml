abstract:
- content: 'A workshop of the permanent working group, sponsored by the International
    Association for Fire Safety Science (IAFSS), entitled Large Outdoor Fires and
    the Built Environment(LOF&BE) was held from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on Sunday June
    30, 2019. The workshop was held as a part of the 2019 Interflam Conference in
    Egham, United Kingdom. The working group is co-led by Sara McAllister of the U.S.
    Forest Service, Sayaka Suzuki of National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster,
    and Samuel L. Manzello of NIST''s Engineering Laboratory. The IAFSS permanent
    working group consists of three subgroups, with subleaders appointed by Manzello,
    McAllister, and Suzuki, and these are prioritized into the following topics: Ignition
    Resistant Communities (IRC, led by Elsa Pastor, UPC), Emergency Management and
    Evacuation (EME, led by Enrico Ronchi, Lund University), and Large Outdoor Firefighting
    (LOFF, led by Raphaele Blanchi, CSIRO, unable to travel to UK). The IRC subgroup
    is focused on developing the scientific basis for new standard testing methodologies
    indicative of large outdoor fire exposures, including the development of necessary
    testing methodologies to characterize wildland fuel treatments adjacent to communities.
    The EME subgroup is focused on developing the scientific basis for effective emergency
    management strategies for communities exposed to large outdoor fires. The LOFF
    subgroup is providing a review of various tactics that are used, as well as the
    various personal protective equipment (PPE), and suggest pathways for research
    community engagement, including environmental issues in suppressing these fires.
    At the workshop, detailed progress was presented regarding activities of all the
    subgroups. An extended session was held for open discussion so that participants
    could provide feedback on current progress and offer suggestions for the upcoming
    LOF&BE workshop being organized as part of IAFSS 2020.'
