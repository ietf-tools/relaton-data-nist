abstract:
- content: The purpose of this guideline is to assist organizations in the development
    of a continuous monitoring strategy and the implementation of a continuous monitoring
    program providing visibility into organizational assets, awareness of threats
    and vulnerabilities, and visibility into the effectiveness of deployed security
    controls. It provides ongoing assurance that planned and implemented security
    controls are aligned with organizational risk tolerance as well as the information
    needed to respond to risk in a timely manner should observations indicate that
    the security controls are inadequate.
