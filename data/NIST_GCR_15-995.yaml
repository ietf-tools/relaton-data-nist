abstract:
- content: 'There are many types of first-responder equipment; sophisticated system-of-systems
    technologies that pervade the contemporary public safety environment and engage
    NIST''s measurement scientists and technologists in some of their most challenging
    and beneficial work. NIST''s participation in Standards Development Organizations
    (SDOs), most often early, and behind the scenes, is the subject of this report.
    Six priority areas are explored where NISTs collaboration with industry, universities,
    international partners, trade associations, responders, standard development organizations
    and Federal, State and local agencies has led to important enhancements of public
    safety: Blast Resistant Trash Receptacles; Personal Protective Equipment; Explosives
    Trace Detection; X-Ray Standards for Bulk Explosives Detection; ? Biothreat Agents
    (White Powder); and Emergency Response Robots.'
