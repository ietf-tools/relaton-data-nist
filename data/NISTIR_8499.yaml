abstract:
- content: The ASTM E2919-22 standard provides a test method for evaluating 3D scanners
    for static pose. This standard was developed in conjunction with the industry
    and NIST led this effort and published the standard in initially in 2014. This
    standard was revised and the Intelligent Systems Division at NIST led this effort.
    This report introduces methods to calculate orientation error and uncertainty
    from 3D point cloud data of physical artifacts.
