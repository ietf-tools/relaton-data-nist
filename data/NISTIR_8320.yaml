abstract:
- content: In today's cloud data centers and edge computing, attack surfaces have
    shifted and, in some cases, significantly increased. At the same time, hacking
    has become industrialized, and most security control implementations are not coherent
    or consistent. The foundation of any data center or edge computing security strategy
    should be securing the platform on which data and workloads will be executed and
    accessed. The physical platform represents the first layer for any layered security
    approach and provides the initial protections to help ensure that higher-layer
    security controls can be trusted. This report explains hardware-enabled security
    techniques and technologies that can improve platform security and data protection
    for cloud data centers and edge computing.
