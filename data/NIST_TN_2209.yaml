abstract:
- content: A high-level review was conducted of design criteria in the United States
    for major components of the built environment for selected design and construction
    codes, reference standards, and best practices. The intent of the review is to
    gauge the expected performance of current building and infrastructure design from
    a community resilience perspective for natural hazard events. Design criteria
    that support community resilience were evaluated, including design hazard characterization,
    expected performance, recovery of function, interdependency issues, and emerging
    methods. The impact of changing environmental conditions on infrastructure design
    and performance was also examined, and areas needing improvement are identified.
    The review focused on design criteria related to flood, wind, and seismic hazards.
    Likewise, the systems of the built environment reviewed include buildings, water
    and wastewater systems, electrical power systems, and transportation systems.
    Although community resilience depends on the performance of existing buildings
    and infrastructure, this report focuses on design criteria for new construction
    to inform future codes, standards, regulations, and best practices. Technical
    topics to improve the performance and recovery of the built environment for a
    range of hazard types and to advance the methods and tools available to support
    resilient systems and communities for stakeholders are identified. The target
    audience of this report includes industry associations, design professionals,
    community building code officials, community and city planners, and researchers.
