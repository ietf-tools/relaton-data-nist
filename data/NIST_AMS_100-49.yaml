abstract:
- content: 'This report provides a statistical review of the U.S. manufacturing industry.
    There are three aspects of U.S. manufacturing that are considered: (1) how the
    U.S. industry compares to other countries, (2) the trends in the domestic industry,
    and (3) the industry trends compared to those in other countries. The U.S. remains
    a major manufacturing nation; however, other countries are rising rapidly. Manufacturing
    in the U.S. was significantly impacted by the pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease
    2019 (COVID-19). Although U.S. manufacturing performs well in many respects, there
    are opportunities for advancing competitiveness. This will require strategic placement
    of resources to ensure that U.S. investments have the highest return possible.'
