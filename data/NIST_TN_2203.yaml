abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology is currently conducting
    a series of large compartment fire tests to investigate the behavior and fire-induced
    failure mechanisms of the full-scale composite floor assemblies with the two-story
    steel gravity frame, two bays by three bays in plan. This report presents the
    experimental design and results from the second fire experiment (Test #2) conducted
    at the National Fire Research Laboratory. The Test #2 was aimed to investigate
    the influence of the slab reinforcement on the structural integrity of the 9.1
    m 6.1 m steel-concrete composite floor subjected to combined mechanical loads
    and compartment fire exposure. The fire test bay was situated on the ground floor
    in the middle edge bay of the two-story test building. The floor slab in the test
    bay was reinforced with the No.3 deformed bars placed 30 cm on center (230 mm2/m).
    The test floor was hydraulically loaded to 2.7 kPa to mimic the code-prescribed
    gravity loads for fire conditions. The natural gas burners created a peak gas
    temperature exceeding 1100 C below the test floor. The test fire lasted about
    131 min, but the hydraulic loading was not removed until the test floor cooled
    down over 2 hours. This experimental study confirmed that the steel reinforcement
    played a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the composite floor under
    prolonged compartment fire exposure. The mid-panel vertical displacement increased
    at a rate less than 1 mm/ C as the protected steel beams were heated to 850 C
    on average. The peak vertical displacement of the test slab was recorded 475 mm
    surpassing the displacement limit prescribed in the standard fire test. Although
    the test slab developed extensive surface cracks, it successfully contained the
    test fire underneath while sustaining the imposed loads simultaneously. The test
    floor retained the post-fire flexural strength exceeding 90 % of the ambient design
    strength of the composite secondary beam prior to fire exposure. The experimental
    results presented in this report can be used for validation of predictive models
    to perform parametric studies incorporating the variability in the steel reinforcement
    scheme (area, spacing, and material) for safer and cost-effective composite floor
    construction for fire safety.'
