abstract:
- content: To support NOAA's Marine Mammal Health and Stranding program, NIST Charleston
    was requested to investigate the feasibility of measuring polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marine mammal blubber. Marine mammal blubber can possess
    high (mg/kg) concentrations of persistent organic pollutants that may interfere
    with measuring PAHs. The major goals for this study are (1) to determine if laboratories
    can differentiate PAHs from the persistent organic pollutant (POP)-dominated background
    typically seen in blubber samples and (2) to determine if POPs in blubber can
    result in false-positive detections of PAHs such as those arising from laboratory
    contamination. Five samples were distributed; PAH amended and unamended extracts
    from high and low POP marine mammal blubber, respectively, and a solution amended
    with individual PAH compounds. Results from this study indicate that PAHs can
    be measured in marine mammal blubber and differentiated from POPs co-occurring
    in the sample. Laboratories did not report PAHs in high POP, non-PAH amended blubber
    extracts indicating that for this study there were few (<10 total) false positive
    PAH detections.
