abstract:
- content: There is ongoing activity within ASTM E57.02 working group WK43218 [1]
    to develop a documentary standard for point-to-point distance performance evaluation
    of 3D imaging systems. The Dimensional Metrology Group (DMG) at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established facilities to realize all of
    the test procedures in the current draft. The DMG hosted an instrument runoff
    and meeting in the first week of May 2016 to allow manufacturers of 3D imaging
    systems to run through these test procedures. The runoff occurred between Monday
    5/2/2016 and Wednesday 5/4/2016 and a meeting was held on Thursday 5/5/2016 to
    discuss findings. This report provides background information related to this
    effort and an overview of key discussions and findings during and immediately
    after the runoff.
