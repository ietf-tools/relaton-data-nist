abstract:
- content: Managing the data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and actuators
    is one of the biggest challenges faced when deploying an IoT system. Traditional
    cloud-based IoT systems are challenged by the large scale, heterogeneity, and
    high latency witnessed in some cloud ecosystems. One solution is to decentralize
    applications, management, and data analytics into the network itself using a distributed
    and federated computer model. This approach has become known as fog computing.
    This document presents a definition of fog and mist computing and how they relate
    to cloud-based computing models for IoT. This document further characterizes important
    properties and aspects of fog computing, including service models, deployment
    strategies, and provides a baseline of what fog computing is, and how it may be
    used.
