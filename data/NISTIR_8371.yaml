abstract:
- content: To ensure NIST is taking a strategic and long-term approach to building
    a diverse workforce, explicit steps should be taken in hiring practices. The best
    practices described in this report provide a roadmap for Hiring Managers, whether
    hiring a part-time student researcher or filling a full-time permanent career
    position. The focus of this report is on practices that target the science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) workforce at NIST, but they can be extended to other
    career tracks as well. Using these practices, NIST can achieve greater organizational
    diversity, improve innovation, and find top talent using evidencebased, effective
    intervention strategies. The report also provides additional information about
    the value proposition of diversity and inclusion for productive, innovative workplaces.
    This report reflects the status of NIST programs and plans as of spring 2021.
