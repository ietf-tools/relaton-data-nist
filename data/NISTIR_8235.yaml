abstract:
- content: Public safety officials utilizing the forthcoming public safety broadband
    networks will have access to devices, such as mobile devices, tablets and wearables.
    These devices offer new ways for first responders to complete their missions but
    may also introduce new security vulnerabilities to their work environment. To
    investigate this impact, the security objectives identified in NIST Interagency
    Report (NISTIR) 8196, Security Analysis of First Responder Mobile and Wearable
    Devices, were used to scope the analysis of public safety mobile and wearable
    devices and the current capabilities that meet those security objectives. The
    ultimate goal of this effort is to provide guidance that enables jurisdictions
    to select and purchase secure devices and assist industry to design and build
    secure devices tailored to the needs of first responders.
