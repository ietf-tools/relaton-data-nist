abstract:
- content: A wide variability in accuracy exists among commercial radiation detection
    instruments used to measure exposure rate or ambient dose equivalent rate. These
    instruments are used to measure both the radiation background and the radiation
    field produced by radioactive sources that are used to test other types of radiation
    detection systems against different consensus document standards. These instruments
    are used as reference instruments. This document provides information and recommendations
    on how to characterize ionization chambers including high pressure ionization
    chambers (HPIC) and unsealed standard ionization chambers.
