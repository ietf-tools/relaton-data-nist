abstract:
- content: Each year since 1976, the town of Twinsburg, Ohio has held a Twins Days
    Festival. Over the past 43 years over 77,000 sets of twins and multiples have
    attended ⁰₃ with many repeat visits over the years. Prof. Jeremy Dawson and other
    staff from the West Virginia University Biometrics Collection Lab have engaged
    with the Twins Days organizers since 2010 to collect biometric data from twins
    attending the festivals; the collections were carried out under Institutional
    Review Board (IRB) protocols and with informed consent of the individuals participating.
    NIST recently obtained copies of the Twins Day data for use in ongoing evaluations
    of face, finger and iris recognition algorithms. This paper is an initial analysis
    of the iris images taken at the 2010 festival. We see no evidence that the non-mated
    distribution for identical twin pairs is significantly different from that for
    unrelated individuals for two commercial iris recognition algorithms. This is
    not a surprise; Daugman demonstrated, using iris2pi, that a non-mated distribution
    of match scores from genetically identical left/right pairs from the same individual
    is not significantly different from that for pairs from different individuals
    and recently demonstrated results on twins similar to what we found. Analysis
    of iris images from subsequent festivals as well as face and finger images are
    planned.
