abstract:
- content: This document provides Federal agencies with a definition of attribute
    based access control (ABAC). ABAC is a logical access control methodology where
    authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes
    associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some cases,
    environment conditions against policy, rules, or relationships that describe the
    allowable operations for a given set of attributes. This document also provides
    considerations for using ABAC to improve information sharing within organizations
    and between organizations while maintaining control of that information.
