abstract:
- content: This report was written by staff of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC, the
    Commission) under an interagency agreement in support of the Commission's effort
    to address the carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning hazard associated with consumer
    use of portable generators. This report presents a plan for a computer simulation
    study to support CPSC staff's evaluation of the effectiveness of CO mitigation
    requirements that were adopted in two voluntary standards in 2018. These two standards
    are ANSI/PGMA G300-2018, Safety and Performance of Portable Generators (referred
    to as PGMA G300) and ANSI/UL 2201-2018, Carbon Monoxide (CO) Emission Rate of
    Portable Generators (referred to as UL 2201). Both voluntary standards have requirements
    for a system that will shut the generator off when specific CO concentrations
    are present near the generator. PGMA G300 also has notification requirements to
    alert the user of the presence of CO after the generator has shut off, while UL
    2201 has a reduced CO emission rate requirement. To support CPSC staff's evaluation
    of the effectiveness of these requirements in addressing the CO hazard, this report
    documents the plan for conducting a computer simulation study and for analyzing
    the output of that study. The methodology is largely similar to that used by CPSC
    staff to evaluate the benefits of the proposed rule issued by the Commission in
    2016. This simulation study will use the same forty buildings, weather conditions,
    and generator characteristics to study the rate at which the CO emitted from the
    generator accumulates in, transports within, and leaves the homes and detached
    garages for generators with and without CO safety shutoff systems. The plan includes
    over 900 scenarios that will be considered in all the buildings, which will require
    more than a million simulations and subsequent analysis of the simulation outputs.
