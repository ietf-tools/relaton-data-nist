abstract:
- content: 'Fire suppression tactics using hose streams can affect ventilation in
    a structure and may impact the movement of smoke and heat through a structure.
    Seven series of experiments were conducted to study the impact of different hose
    stream and nozzle movement pattern combinations on air movement within residential
    scale structures. The experiments studied four different hose streams: a straight
    stream, narrow fog stream, and a wide fog stream from a combination nozzle and
    a solid stream from a smooth bore nozzle. The streams were applied from a static,
    or fixed, position; by moving the hoseline left-to-right across the room in a
    sweeping motion; and by rotating the hoseline in both the clockwise and counterclockwise
    directions. Gas velocity was measured at different locations in the structure
    during the experiments. The wide fog stream caused the most air movement out of
    any of the tested streams, reaching a maximum velocity of 2.6 m/s (5.8 mph) and
    maximum air flow rate of approximately 4.2 m^3/s (9000 cfm), followed by the narrow
    fog stream, and then the straight stream and solid stream from the smooth bore
    nozzle, which both caused approximately the same amount of air movement through
    the structure. It was discovered that the straight stream only caused air movement
    through the structure when it was applied in a moving pattern. Furthermore, there
    were no statistically significant differences in the average measured air velocity
    between the clockwise and counterclockwise nozzle movement patterns. It was determined
    that the type of hose stream and manner in which it is applied dictates the extent
    to which a stream impacts the ventilation of a structure. To better quantify the
    impact of such air flows on the fire environment, additional experiments need
    to be conducted with structure fires in a controlled environment.'
