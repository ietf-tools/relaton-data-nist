abstract:
- content: In September 2014, the Applied Technology Council (ATC) commenced a task
    order project under National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Contract
    SB1341-13-CQ-0009 to conduct comprehensive review of the generalized component
    models published in the current ASCE/SEI standard and relevant research, and develop
    recommendations for improvement (ATC-114 Project). The need for defining parameters
    for nonlinear force-deformation models for components, elements, or assemblies
    is identified as a high-priority research and development topic in NIST GCR 14-917-27
    report, Nonlinear Analysis Study and Development Program for Performance-Based
    Seismic Engineering, (NIST, 2013) which outlines a research and development program
    for addressing the gap between state-of-the-art academic research and state-of-practice
    engineering applications for nonlinear structural analysis, analytical structural
    modeling, and computer simulation in support of performance-based seismic engineering.
    The current standard, ASCE/SEI 41-13, Seismic Evaluation and Retrofit of Existing
    Buildings (ASCE, 2014), is widely used by designers for evaluating and upgrading
    existing buildings. The component models in the current standard were developed
    for use in existing building analysis, but they have also become widely employed
    in new building analysis. The purpose of this report is to recommend broad improvements
    to seismic nonlinear modeling and acceptance criteria requirements for different
    structural systems.
