abstract:
- content: This specification describes a data format for space-constrained environments,
    such as the placement of machine readable data on paper. The specification is
    responsive to a need for interoperability in several key voting system scenarios
    in which the use of other storage mechanisms are impractical or disallowed. The
    format s structure is described in prose and code examples.
