abstract:
- content: The Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology (IT) Systems
    provides instructions, recommendations, and considerations for government IT contingency
    planning. Contingency planning refers to interim measures to recover IT services
    after an emergency or system disruption. Interim measures may include the relocation
    of IT systems and operations to an alternate site, the recovery of IT functions
    using alternate equipment, or the performance of IT functions using manual methods.
    The information presented in this document addresses specific contingency planning
    recommendations and provides strategies and techniques common to desktops and
    portable systems, servers, Web sites, local area networks, wide area networks,
    distributed systems, and mainframe systems.The document also defines the following
    seven-step contingency process that an agency may apply to develop and maintain
    a viable contingency planning program for their IT systems. These seven progressive
    steps develop the contingency planning policy statement, conduct the business
    impact analysis (BIA), identify preventive controls, develop recovery strategies,
    develop an IT contingency plan, plan testing/training/exercises, and plan maintenance
    are designed to be integrated into each stage of the system development life cycle.
