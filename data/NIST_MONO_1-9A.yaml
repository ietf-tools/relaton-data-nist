abstract:
- content: This report analyzes the global response of WTC 7 to fire-induced structural
    failures and the resulting sequence of component and subsystem failures to determine
    the events that led to the global collapse of the building. The analysis involved
    a finite element model of the entire building, which was developed in LS-DYNA.
    Preliminary work involved two-story and 14 story subassemblies. The 47 story global
    model was based on the original structural drawings as well as construction fabrication
    shop drawings for connections. The model included the primary structural components
    throughout the building, including exterior and core columns, floor framing beams
    and girders, floor slabs, column transfer truss structures, wind bracing truss
    members, and penthouse structures.
