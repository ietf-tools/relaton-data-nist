abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance and resources for how to test voting systems
    against the usability and accessibility requirements in the Voluntary Voting System
    Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0. The requirements include Principles 2.2 and 5 through 8.
    The goal of those requirements is to ensure that voting systems certified to VVSG
    2.0 are accessible and usable for election workers and voters including voters
    with disabilities so that every voter can mark, review, cast, and verify their
    ballot independently and privately. The primary audiences for this guide are the
    voting system test laboratory organizations who perform certification testing,
    to help them understand some of the specialized tests required, and organizations
    in the design and development process as they build and prepare a voting system
    for certification testing.
