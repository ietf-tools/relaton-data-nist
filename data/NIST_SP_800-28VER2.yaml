abstract:
- content: Active content technologies allow code, in the form of a script, macro,
    or other kind of portable instruction representation, to execute when the document
    is rendered. Like any technology, active content can be used to deliver essential
    services, but it can also become a source of vulnerability for exploitation by
    an attacker. The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of active
    content and mobile code technologies in use today and offer insights for making
    informed IT security decisions on their application and treatment. The discussion
    gives details about the threats, technology risks, and safeguards for end user
    systems, such as desktops and laptops. Although various end user applications,
    such as email clients, can involve active content, Web browsers remain the primary
    vehicle for delivery and are underscored in the discussion. The tenets presented
    for Web browsers apply equally well to other end user applications and can be
    inferred directly.
