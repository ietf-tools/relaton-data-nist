abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is commencing
    the implementation of certain statistical procedures, namely errors-in-variables
    regression and Monte Carlo uncertainty evaluation, into the data analysis and
    reporting for the force calibration service provided by the NIST Physical Measurement
    Laboratory (PML). This document is intended to serve as an overview of these procedures
    to the users of NIST's force calibration service, by presenting computational
    details of the analyses and introducing the corresponding format for the force
    calibration report.
