abstract:
- content: Transactive energy may provide a way to support integration of customer
    distributed energy resources (DER) into the electric grid and to help manage DER
    flexibility to support distribution system and bulk grid needs. Use of DER flexibility
    includes peak shifting in response to forward market prices, real-time regulation
    in response to 5-minute prices, and, potentially, voltage regulation in response
    to distribution nodal prices. The work presented here compares two approaches
    for managing heat pump cooling to provide grid services. The first approach implements
    a rule-based real-time controller that manages power consumption based on 5-minute
    real-time prices. The second controller uses a model-based approach to optimize
    load based on day-ahead hourly prices. These approaches are evaluated on two reference
    grids using GridLAB-D with the same weather and price information. The real-time
    controller reacts to a volatile price signal to reduce homeowner energy use and
    energy costs. The model-based controller minimizes energy use by pre-cooling before
    the price peak and allowing indoor temperature to drift up during peak price times.
    The model-based controller strategy results in cost savings when temperatures
    are allowed to move farther from the desired setpoint. Because this controller
    does not respond to real-time price volatility, there are no cost savings during
    sub-hourly real-time price spikes. Simulation results show both controllers adjusting
    temperature setpoints in response to price movement, reducing customer cost while
    staying within pre-defined comfort boundaries. These temperature adjustments resulted
    in significant power flow volatility at the substation. The average power flow
    change for the real-time controller, time step to time step, was approximately
    10 % of the peak load. Some observed power flow changes were equivalent to simultaneously
    turning off or on all price-responsive loads on the grid. This power flow volatility
    resulted in voltage volatility at customer meters and greatly increased voltage
    regulator and capacitor bank actions on one of the tested grids. Analysis suggests
    that power flow volatility may be expected when many devices are price-responsive
    and controllers have the goal of reducing cost without considering voltage. Care
    must be taken to reduce the volatility of the price signal and boost hosting capacity
    to support synchronized price response by a large percentage of load.
