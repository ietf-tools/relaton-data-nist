abstract:
- content: This NIST Special Publication provides guidance for federal procurement
    initiators, contracting officers, and computer security officials on including
    computer security in acquisitions. To accomplish this goal, computer security
    and federal information processing (FIP) procurement must be integrated. Computer
    security is the protection of the integrity, availability and confidentiality
    of automated information and the resources used to enter, store, process, and
    communicate the information. Computer security shares properties with systems/software
    engineering including trustworthiness, system safety, and reliability. FIP procurement
    is the process of acquiring hardware, software, firmware, computer-related services
    and telecommunications. FIP procurement begins with the process of determining
    needs and ends with contract completion.
