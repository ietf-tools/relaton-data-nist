abstract:
- content: This report documents the design and performance of a second-generation
    phi meter used in multi-scale experimental applications. A constructed second-generation
    phi meter is implemented in bench and 2/5th scale experiments to demonstrate the
    instrument s ability to conduct global and local equivalence ratio measurements
    and gas species concentrations of combustion products (i.e., carbon dioxide, water
    vapor, and oxygen) without knowledge of the sampled fuel composition. Bench-scale
    experiments evaluated the second-generation phi meter s functionality by introducing
    known fuel-air ratios into the instrument and verifying measurements via the carbon
    to hydrogen ratio and mass balance. The bench-scale experiments selected methane,
    propane, and propene as the fuels of interest. The 2/5th scale experiments implemented
    two second-generation phi meters in a series of 25 kW methane backdraft experiments.
    Backdraft experiments provided an ideal setting to test the phi meter s performance
    by subjecting the instrument to a transient heterogeneous gas mixture. The phi
    meters sampling location was positioned such that the extracted gas samples fed
    into the instrument were unknown. Global and local equivalence ratio measurements
    made in the 2/5th scale compartment were compared to independent gas analyzer
    and gas chromatograph measurements. In the bench-scale experiments, the global
    equivalence ratio, water vapor concentration, and carbon to hydrogen ratio measurements
    are in fair agreement with their expected values. Real-time global and local equivalence
    ratio and carbon to hydrogen ratio measurements obtained during a backdraft experiment
    were observed to increase as the fuel concentration within the 2/5th scale compartment
    increased. Real-time global and local equivalence ratios were verified by the
    independent instrumentation.
