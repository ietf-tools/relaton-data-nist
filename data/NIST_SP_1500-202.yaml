abstract:
- content: 'Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) comprise interacting digital, analog, physical,
    and human components engineered for function through integrated physics and logic.
    CPS and related systems (including the Internet of Things, Industrial Internet,
    and more) are widely recognized as having great potential to enable innovative
    applications and impact multiple economic sectors in the world-wide economy. These
    application areas include energy infrastructures, advanced manufacturing, building
    control, transportation, health care, and others. NIST established the CPS Public
    Working Group (CPS PWG) to bring together a broad range of CPS experts in an open
    public forum to help define and shape key characteristics of CPS, so as to better
    manage development and implementation within and across multiple ''smart'' application
    domains, including smart manufacturing, transportation, energy, and healthcare.
    The resulting CPS Framework provides an organized presentation of a CPS analysis
    methodology based on the CPS Framework core concepts of facets (modes of the system
    engineering process: conceptualization, realization and assurance) and aspects
    (clusters of concerns: functional, business, human, trustworthiness, timing, data,
    composition, boundaries, and lifecycle). This volume contains the products of
    the individual working groups.'
