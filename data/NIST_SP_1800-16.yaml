abstract:
- content: Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates are critical to the
    security of both internet- facing and private web services. Despite the critical
    importance of these certificates, many organizations lack a formal TLS certificate
    management program and do not have the ability to centrally monitor and manage
    their certificates. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide shows large and medium
    enterprises how to employ a formal TLS certificate management program to address
    certificate-based risks and challenges. It describes the TLS certificate management
    challenges faced by organizations; provides recommended best practices for large-scale
    TLS server certificate management; describes an automated proof-of-concept implementation
    that demonstrates how to prevent, detect, and recover from certificate-related
    incidents; and provides a mapping of the demonstrated capabilities to the recommended
    best practices and to NIST security guidelines and frameworks.
