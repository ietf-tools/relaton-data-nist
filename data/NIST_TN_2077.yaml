abstract:
- content: The National Fire Research Laboratory is a unique large-fire research facility;
    able to characterize the response of full-scale building systems to realistic
    mechanical loading and fire. The facility maintains an infrastructure of measurements
    necessary for accurately characterizing the heat release rate of fires, a key
    parameter in predicting fire hazard. This measurement infrastructure includes
    four oxygen consumption calorimeters to measure the heat released during fire
    experiments, and a fuel consumption calorimetry system (natural gas burners and
    flow control) to generate precise amounts of heat release. Both systems have a
    heat release rate capacity of 20 MW, twice the capacity of the previous facility.
    A rigorous evaluation of the processes for the measurements by oxygen consumption
    calorimetry and fuel consumption calorimetry has resulted in significant improvements
    in measurement uncertainty when compared to previous versions of the facility.
    Measurement agreement between the two independent systems has been demonstrated
    and provides evidence that NFRL's system of heat release rate measurements for
    large-scale fire research are the most accurate and highly characterized of their
    kind. The methodology, hardware, and performance of the large-fire calorimeters
    and natural gas flow system are described here to provide technical guidance on
    achieving accurate heat release measurements to laboratories with the mission
    of accurate large-scale fire testing.
