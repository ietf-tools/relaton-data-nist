abstract:
- content: Exhaust flow measurements have been found to be a significant source of
    uncertainty for measurements of heat release rate in large-scale fire experiments.
    Asymmetric or skewed velocity distributions are often present in the exhaust ducts
    for open calorimetry systems used in large-fire research facilities, therefore
    making it difficult to measure exhaust flow accurately. Tracer gas dilution is
    a standard test method for determining volume flow in ducts. It is not sensitive
    to flow distribution and is derived from measurements independent of most flow
    monitoring techniques. Therefore, it is well suited for in-line calibrations of
    flow measurement devices in the exhaust ducts of facilities conducting large-scale
    fire experiments. For the first time, the method has been applied to calibrate
    the routine exhaust flow measurements at the National Fire Research Laboratory
    as a means to reduce the measurement uncertainty associated with open calorimetry
    systems. Measurement uncertainty for the calibration is estimated at 3 % and accounts
    for potential error due to incomplete mixing of the tracer. Multi-port sampling
    of the tracer, which is not part of the existing standard test method, is also
    demonstrated as a means to reduce the potential for measurement error due to incomplete
    mixing. Exhaust velocity and mass flow are necessary to compute heat release rate,
    and both are determined by averaging pitot probes installed in the exhaust ducts.
    An in-line calibration of the averaging pitot probes was conducted using tracer
    gas dilution. Measurement uncertainty for calibrated exhaust velocity and calibrated
    mass flow is estimated at 3 %. The in-line calibration of the exhaust flow measurement
    is an improvement over the accepted practice of comparing oxygen consumption calorimetry
    with heat release rate measured at a gas burner to develop a correction for the
    flow measurement. It is valid for a wide range of flow conditions and decouples
    measurement error between oxygen consumption calorimetry and fuel consumption
    calorimetry; therefore improving overall measurement accuracy for heat release
    rate.
