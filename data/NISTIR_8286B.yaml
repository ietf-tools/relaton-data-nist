abstract:
- content: This document is the second in a series that supplements NIST Interagency/Internal
    Report (NISTIR) 8286, Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management
    (ERM). This series provides additional detail regarding the enterprise application
    of cybersecurity risk information; the previous document, NISTIR 8286A, provided
    detail regarding stakeholder risk guidance and risk identification and analysis.
    This second publication describes the need for determining the priorities of each
    of those risks in light of their potential impact on enterprise objectives, as
    well as options for properly treating that risk. This report describes how risk
    priorities and risk response information are added to the cybersecurity risk register
    (CSRR) in support of an overall enterprise risk register. Information about the
    selection of and projected cost of risk response will be used to maintain a composite
    view of cybersecurity risks throughout the enterprise, which may be used to confirm
    and, if necessary, adjust risk strategy to ensure mission success.
