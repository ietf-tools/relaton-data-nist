abstract:
- content: This document provides the empirical rationale for critical patient safety
    related usability guidelines for standardization and requirements for validation
    testing to ensure safety-enhanced design. These standardization guidelines are
    targeted at eliminating never events and associated patient harm by proactively
    addressing and mitigating the root causes of use errors from Electronic Health
    Record (EHR) design and implementation elements, as characterized in our framework
    on the relationship between usability and patient safety (NISTIR 7804). Requirements
    for validation testing are instantiated through realistic use cases (that were
    developed in the course of this research) can be applied during design and evaluation
    of EHR systems and for user performance testing. The ultimate goal is to drive
    and empower effective and safe human performance in the use of EHRs. This research
    drew upon five different methods of empirical human performance data collection,
    utilizing cross-cutting analytic methods, with a diverse set of analysts from
    different disciplines, backgrounds, and perspectives. Researchers used this mixed
    method approach in order to capture user expectations, knowledge, and outcomes
    regarding EHRs. Human factors guidelines for standardization, which were explicitly
    derived from the empirical evidence obtained through field data collection, are
    provided to improve the safety-related usability of EHRs in three critical use
    risk areas. Ultimately, this research demonstrates that patient safety is negatively
    affected when critical safety tasks are performed with the support of poorly-designed
    EHRs, in part because mistakes and errors frequently occur, and in part because
    users who become frustrated and unwilling to trust the systems they are given
    are more likely to rely on potentially unsafe workarounds.
