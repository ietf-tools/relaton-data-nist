abstract:
- content: Non-fungible token (NFT) technology provides a mechanism to enable real
    assets (both virtual and physical) to be sold and exchanged on a blockchain. While
    NFTs are most often used for autographing digital assets (associating oneâ€™s name
    with a digital object), they utilize a strong cryptographic foundation that may
    enable them to regularly support ownership-transferring sales of digital and physical
    objects. For this, NFT implementations need to address potential security concerns
    to reduce the risk to purchasers. This publication explains NFT technology and
    then identifies and discusses a list of 27 potential security issues. All of the
    identified issues can be addressed through use of a systematic security approach
    that promotes a secure design and implementation.
