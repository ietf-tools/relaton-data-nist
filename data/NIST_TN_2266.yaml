abstract:
- content: Reference buildings have been defined previously and successfully applied
    to energy and indoor air quality analyses, providing a platform for consistent
    comparisons between different building design and operation scenarios. One such
    set of reference buildings, the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s
    (NIST) suite of homes, is a collection of dwellings developed to represent 80
    % of the U.S. housing stock at the time of their development [1]. A second set
    is the Department of Energy’s commercial prototype building models, which is a
    collection of buildings developed to represent U.S. commercial and institutional
    buildings [2]. These building models allow for the assessment of new technologies
    and the resulting impacts on building energy efficiency, ventilation, and indoor
    air quality. In addition to the aforementioned aspects of building performance,
    water quality and efficiency are also of current interest [3]. A building’s premise
    plumbing system plays a critical role in managing water quality and efficiency
    by bringing in clean, potable water and removing wastewater and can impact health
    and safety of building occupants. Using models to evaluate the performance of
    premise plumbing systems can be useful but most studies have considered different
    buildings with different plumbing systems. In order to support more consistent
    modeling efforts, NIST has developed premise plumbing system models for three
    residential buildings and four commercial buildings and has made them available
    for researchers and industry to analyze system performance, new technologies,
    and design & operation strategies. This report describes the seven plumbing system
    designs, how they were developed and how they can be accessed.
