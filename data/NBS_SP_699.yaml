abstract:
- content: Contained herein is a bibliography of sources of experimental and correlated
    thermodynamic data for the systems CO2 + NH3 + H2O, CO2 + H2S + H2O, H2S + NH3
    + H2O, and CO2 + NH3 + H2S + H2O. The types of data in this bibliography include
    all types of equilibrium data, including both equilibria in solution and vapor-liquid
    equilibrium data, enthalpies, heat capacities, and densities. There are 215 references
    cited.
