abstract:
- content: This publication helps teleworkers secure the external devices they use
    for telework, such as personally owned and privately owned desktop and laptop
    computers and consumer devices (e.g., cell phones, personal digital assistants
    [PDA]). The document focuses specifically on security for telework involving remote
    access to their organization's nonpublic computing resources. It provides practical,
    real-world recommendations for securing telework computers operating systems (OS)
    and applications, as well as home networks that the computers use. It presents
    basic recommendations for securing consumer devices used for telework. The document
    also presents advice on protecting the information stored on telework computers
    and removable media. In addition, it provides tips on considering the security
    of a device owned by a third party before deciding whether it should be used for
    telework.
