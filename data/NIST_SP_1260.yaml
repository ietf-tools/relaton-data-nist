abstract:
- content: This report introduces features of the Economic Decision Guide Software
    (EDGe) Online Tool V 1.0 and presents a case study of wildfire planning in the
    wildland-urban interface (WUI). The case study highlights the competing interests
    of two neighboring communities by evaluating the same project alternatives from
    the point of view of each community. The WUI case study also demonstrates the
    importance of considering co-benefits and approaches to incorporating non- market
    valuation. The report presents a walkthrough of EDGe Online and closes with a
    discussion of implications from the presented case study and potential future
    research.
