abstract:
- content: This document is a companion of NIST Special Publication 260-136 (2020
    Edition), intended for users of NIST reference materials, that explains how NIST
    evaluates and expresses measurement uncertainty associated with certified or with
    non-certified values, and exemplifies how such uncertainty may be propagated to
    derivative quantities that involve these values. The first few pages include navigation
    aids that enable direct and easy access to examples that illustrate different
    ways of expressing uncertainty, and to specific reference materials mentioned
    in this document. The document reviews the concepts of measurement, measurement
    uncertainty, and reference material, and includes a refresher of concepts from
    probability and statistics that are commonly used in certificates of NIST reference
    materials. The bulk of the document comprises concrete, worked out examples of
    how NIST evaluates measurement uncertainty for NIST reference materials, and of
    how this uncertainty is expressed, and how it may be propagated in applications
    that use NIST reference materials. Illustrative computer codes are included in
    an appendix.
