abstract:
- content: The NIST Dietary Supplement Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (DSQAP)
    was established in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
    Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2007 to enable members of the dietary supplement
    community to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance
    with various regulations, including the dietary supplement current good manufacturing
    practices (cGMPs). Exercise O of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories
    to assess their in-house measurements of contaminants (arsenic, cadmium, lead,
    mercury), marker compounds in botanicals (curcuminoids) and natural products (chondroitin
    sulfate), and authenticity of Ginkgo biloba materials in botanical dietary supplement
    ingredients and finished products.
