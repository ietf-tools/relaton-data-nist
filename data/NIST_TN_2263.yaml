abstract:
- content: This report documents an experimental program designed to investigate high
    energy arcing fault (HEAF) phenomena for medium-voltage, metal-enclosed bus ducts
    and switchgear. This report covers full-scale laboratory experiments using representative
    nuclear power plant (NPP) three-phase electrical equipment. Electrical, thermal,
    and pressure data were recorded for each experiment and documented in this report.
    This report covers experiments performed on two medium-voltage switchgear units
    and eight non-segregated phase bus ducts. The data collected supports characterization
    of the medium-voltage HEAF hazard, and these results will be used to complement
    the data used for HEAF hazard modeling tools and support potential improvements
    in fire probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods. The experiments were performed
    at KEMA Labs in Chalfont, Pennsylvania. The experimental design, setup, and execution
    were performed by staff from the NRC, the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and KEMA Labs. These experiments
    were sponsored by member countries of the HEAF 2 international agreement under
    the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
    The HEAF experiments were performed between August 22 and September 2, 2022. The
    HEAF experiments were performed on two near-identical units of General Electric
    metal-clad medium-voltage switchgear and eight units of non-segregated phase bus
    duct. A three-phase arcing fault was initiated on the equipmentâ€™s bus bars. These
    experiments used nominal system voltages of either 4.16 kV (AC) or 6.9 kV (AC).
    Arc durations in the experiments ranged from approximately 2 s to 4 s with fault
    currents ranging from approximately 28 kA to 32 kA. Real-time electrical operating
    conditions, including voltage, current, and frequency, were measured during the
    experiments. Heat fluxes and incident energies were measured with plate thermometers
    and slug calorimeters at various locations around the electrical enclosures. Particulate
    samples were taken for subsequent analysis. The experiments were documented with
    normal and high-speed videography, infrared imaging, and photography. Insights
    from the experimental series include timing information related to enclosure breach,
    event progression, mass loss measurements for electrodes and enclosures, peak
    pressure rise, along with visual and thermal imaging data to better understand
    and characterize the hazard. These results will be used to evaluate the adequacy
    of existing HEAF hazard modeling tools and for potential improvements to fire
    probabilistic risk assessment methods related to HEAF.
