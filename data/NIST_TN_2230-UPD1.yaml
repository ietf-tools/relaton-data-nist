abstract:
- content: In the framework of a collaborative project between ASME, NASA, and NIST,
    quasi-static fracture toughness tests have been performed at liquid nitrogen temperature
    (77 K, or -196 °C) and liquid helium temperature (4 K, or -269 °C) on weld specimens
    extracted from the centers of four 316L welded stainless steel plates, each produced
    by a different vendor. Although the plates were produced in accordance with the
    same specifications from the same material (316L), large differences in fracture
    toughness have been observed, with the best weld (W2) exhibiting almost twice
    the critical toughness of the worst (W1) at 77 K (219 kJ/m2 vs. 113 kJ/m2), and
    about seven times the critical toughness of W1 at 4 K (146 kJ/m2 as compared to
    21 kJ/m2). The Charpy absorbed energies recorded at 77 K for three of the welds
    within the same project were found to be strongly linearly correlated with fracture
    toughness at both test temperatures. The exception was weld W4, which provided
    the highest impact toughness and the second lowest quasi-static fracture toughness
    (stable crack initiation and resistance to crack propagation).
