abstract:
- content: This document is the second part of a series of documents on the usability
    of electronic pollbooks. It contains a procedure for how e-pollbooks might be
    evaluated, including a preliminary protocol for running a usability test. It can
    be used by people designing or purchasing an e-pollbook, as a usability component
    for a certification or approval process, or to determine aspects of the product
    that need special attention in training poll workers. This usability testing procedure
    puts an e-pollbook through its paces, allowing discovery of potential usability
    issues before an election. Seeing how people who might be poll workers interact
    with the e-pollbook goes beyond the feature checklist and provides a sense for
    how easy, or hard, it is for poll workers to use the e-pollbook to do their jobs
    on Election Day. Research referenced in this report was conducted in 2017. The
    use of e-pollbooks presented throughout the document reflects the state of elections
    in 2017. In the time since this research was performed, e-pollbooks have made
    progress addressing usability and accessibility issues. Additionally, as part
    of its ongoing Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP) program,
    the Election Assistance Commission developed the Voluntary Electronic Poll Book
    Requirements (VEPBR) in collaboration with NIST. This publication is intended
    to provide a deep dive into how to evaluate the usability and accessibility of
    e-pollbooks in order to meet the relevant VEPBR user-centered design process and
    usability testing requirements as well as any state certifications pertaining
    to usability and accessibility.
