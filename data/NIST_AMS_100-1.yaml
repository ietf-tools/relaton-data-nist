abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a Model-Based
    Enterprise Summit from April 12-14, 2016 with the intention of identifying challenges,
    research, implementation issues, and lessons learned in manufacturing and quality
    assurance where a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as
    the authoritative information source for all activities in the product''s lifecycle.
    This 3D model is considered a model-based definition (MBD) and acts as a digital
    thread of sorts to weave and link all the phases of the product lifecycle together.
    The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and NIST developed a tool to help organizations
    assess whether they are ready for an MBE or smart manufacturing platform. The
    tool was appropriately named: MBE Capability Index Assessment Tool. As part of
    the summit, NIST was also interested in collecting input specific to the MBE Capability
    Index Assessment Tool and the consideration for developing a guidebook for the
    tool.'
