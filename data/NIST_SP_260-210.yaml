abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) 2969 and 2970 are intended for 1) use
    in validating methods for determining concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25(OH)D2)
    and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) in human serum and plasma and 2) value assigning
    in house produced control materials analyzed using those methods. A unit of SRM
    2969 consists of two vials of frozen serum with a low total 25-hydroxyvitamin
    D (25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D2 plus 25(OH)D3) concentrations. A unit of SRM 2970
    consists of two vials of frozen serum with a relatively high 25(OH)D2 concentration.
    This publication documents the production, analytical methods, and statistical
    evaluations involved in characterization of these products.
