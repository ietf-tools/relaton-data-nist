abstract:
- content: This document introduces broadband communication technologies, and the
    security considerations associated with them. It discusses the use of a personal
    firewall, which is essential in protecting a home computer from intrusion; provides
    instructions on how to configure PCs and web browsers for added security. It also
    explains home networking, and how a home network can be protected; and describes
    virtual private networks, which are sophisticated technologies that can provide
    telecommuters with security approximating that available from an isolated inter-office
    network. This publication compares alternative approaches for securing e-mail
    and data transfer, depending on the user's needs and value of the data., and summarizes
    considerations for telecommuting security. Appendixes provide useful checklists,
    software update procedures, and pointers to additional resources available on
    the Internet.
