abstract:
- content: The Slope Determination by the Analysis of Residuals (SDAR) algorithm has
    recently been standardized in ASTM E3076-18 for the determination of the slope
    in the linear region of a test record. It offers an automated and objective linear-fitting
    method, based on the least normalized residual, and in its full form provides
    metrics for evaluating the quality of the test record and of the resultant fit.
    In this investigation, SDAR was used to calculate values of crack size in elastic-plastic
    fracture toughness tests, conducted in accordance with ASTM E1820-18 by means
    of thesingle-specimen elastic compliance methodology. Our analyses show that the
    use of SDAR is not advisable in case of noisy unloading/reloading cycles and/or
    in the presence of significant hysteresis, since the most linear portion identified
    by the algorithm may not necessarily represent the true elasticbehavior of the
    specimen. Such issues could be alleviated by increasing the minimum number of
    data points used from 20 % of the search range (E3076) to at least 50 %. Nevertheless,
    SDAR remains an extremely useful tool to determine a repeatable and operator-independent
    slope in numerous types of mechanical tests, such as tensile tests, linear elastic
    fracture mechanics tests, and others.
