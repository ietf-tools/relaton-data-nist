abstract:
- content: This tutorial is a guide on how to implement the NIST infiltration correlations
    (Ng et al., 2021) into EnergyPlus building energy simulation software for the
    US Department of Energy prototype commercial buildings. The implementation can
    also be generalized to other building energy simulation software and other building
    models.
