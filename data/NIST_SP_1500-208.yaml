abstract:
- content: This is the report of a hybrid working group meeting held on April 25,
    2023, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder,
    CO. The working group was focused on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) research,
    development, and manufacturing. The meeting allowed for productive discussions
    on many technical aspects of EUVL. Industry participants gave presentations that
    helped inform this report's outline of the current state of the science, challenges,
    needs, and future opportunities for accelerated innovation in EUVL. The report
    also includes information on some of NIST’s efforts that could begin or continue
    to support the USA semiconductor industry. Cohesively presenting some of NIST’s
    research and capabilities at the working group meeting provided external stakeholders
    visibility and the opportunity to comment. The meeting was insightful for industry
    participants learning about NIST’s research capabilities .In turn, NIST researchers
    gained a deeper understanding of the industry's needs to identify where NIST’s
    metrology expertise could assist in EUVL research. The meeting and this report
    do not, and are not intended to, capture the entire perspective of the EUVL industry
    but rather serve as a discussion starting point. Future work includes expanding
    participation, honing NIST research sub-groups to specific needs of EUVL, and
    executing priority research discussed in the working group meeting or any future
    meetings. Through engagement with the USA EUVL industry, targeted research collaborations
    are hoped to be created, accelerating semiconductor manufacturing innovation and
    generating meaningful value for USA taxpayers.
