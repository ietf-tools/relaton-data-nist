abstract:
- content: Conformance testing measures whether an implementation faithfully implements
    the technical requirements defined in a standard. Conformance testing provides
    developers, users, and purchasers with increased levels of confidence in product
    quality and increases the probability of successful interoperability. The Information
    Technology Laboratory of NIST (NIST/ITL) sponsored the development of a conformance
    testing methodology for ANSI/NIST-ITL 2011, Data Format for the Interchange of
    Fingerprint, Facial & Other Biometric Information(AN-2011) under the NIST/ITL
    Conformance Testing Methodology Working Group. This testing methodology supports
    the development of conformance test tools designed to test implementations of
    AN-2011 transactions and promotes biometrics conformity assessment efforts. The
    first release includes comprehensive tables of AN-2011 requirements and test assertions
    for a set of supported AN-2011 Record Types. The tables of requirements and assertions
    indicate which assertions apply to the traditional encoding format, the National
    Information Exchange Model (NIEM)-compliant encoding format, or both encoding
    formats. The testing methodology makes use of specific test assertion syntax to
    clearly define the assertions associated with each requirement.
