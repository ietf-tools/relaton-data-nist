abstract:
- content: 'Monitoring the physics of control systems to detect attacks is a growing
    area of research. In its basic form a security monitor creates time-series models
    of sensor readings for an industrial control system and identifies anomalies in
    these measurements in order to identify potentially false control commands or
    false sensor readings. In this paper, we review previous work based on a unified
    taxonomy that allows us to identify limitations, unexplored challenges, and new
    solutions. In particular, we propose a new adversary model and a way to compare
    previous work with a new evaluation metric based on the trade-off between false
    alarms and the negative impact of undetected attacks. We also show the advantages
    and disadvantages of three experimental scenarios to test the performance of attacks
    and defenses: real-world network data captured from a large-scale operational
    facility, a fully-functional testbed that can be used operationally for water
    treatment, and a simulation of frequency control in the power grid.'
