abstract:
- content: 'Electronic mail (email) is perhaps the most popularly used system for
    exchanging information over the Internet. After Web servers, mail servers are
    often the most targeted and attacked hosts on an organization''s network. Various
    types of mail content and attachments have also proven to be effective in introducing
    malicious code into a system through the email client. Thus, it is essential to
    secure mail servers and clients as well as the network infrastructure that supports
    them. This document has been developed to assist federal departments and agencies,
    state agencies, and commercial organizations in installing, configuring, and maintaining
    secure mail servers and mail clients. It presents generic security principles
    and covers details specific to the various components of a mail system. It also
    includes examples that address two of the more popular mail server applications
    running respectively on Unix and Microsoft Windows operating systems: sendmail
    and Exchange.'
