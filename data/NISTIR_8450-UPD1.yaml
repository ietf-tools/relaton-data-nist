abstract:
- content: Encryption technology can be incorporated into access control mechanisms
    based on user identities, user attributes, or resource attributes. Traditional
    public-key encryption requires different data to have different keys that can
    be distributed to users who satisfy perspective access control policies along
    with the encrypted version of the data. However, some distributed or pervasive
    system environments wish to avoid the public-key encryptionâ€™s all-or-nothing data
    access limitation when considering their performance requirements. Attribute-based
    encryption incorporates access control policies and attributes with encryption
    and decryption functions and a one-to-many authorization scheme that requires
    fewer keys than public-key encryption. It also utilizes collusion-resistance,
    which provides a more efficient and flexible attribute-based access control mechanism
    that supports high-performance systems (e.g., cloud, IoT, disrupt-tolerant networks,
    wireless sensor networks, mobile ad-hoc networks, and public search service systems).
