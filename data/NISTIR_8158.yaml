abstract:
- content: The use of biometrics to identify individuals has become an important component
    of efforts to ensure U.S. national security, and has also grown rapidly. Biometrics
    are, for example, an integral part of the United States Visitor and Immigrant
    Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program. To address contagion and speed
    issues, DHS S&T commissioned and funded a project to research technologies that
    could be used to acquire fingerprints without physical contact. Overall the contactless
    scanner took longer to acquire the prints, acquired fewer prints under the no
    instruction and video instructional conditions, and was preferred less than the
    contact scanner.
