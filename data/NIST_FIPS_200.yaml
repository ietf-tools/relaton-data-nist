abstract:
- content: FIPS 200 is the second standard that was specified by the Information Technology
    Management Reform Act of 1996 (FISMA). It is an integral part of the risk management
    framework that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed
    to assist federal agencies in providing levels of information security based on
    levels of risk. FIPS 200 specifies minimum security requirements for federal information
    and information systems and a risk-based process for selecting the security controls
    necessary to satisfy the minimum requirements.
