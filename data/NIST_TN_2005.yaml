abstract:
- content: This report investigates the viability of thermal energy storage by using
    a phase-change material (PCM) for residential air-conditioning. The air-conditioning
    performance and the associated external and internal heat loads to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology's Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility
    (NZERTF) were modelled for a single day near the summer solstice. The transient
    model predicted the frequency and the duration of the cooling cycles for the air-source
    heat pump with and without PCM. The model was used to examine two different PCM
    energy storage configurations for their efficacy in improving energy efficiency
    and/or in meeting the entire peak cooling load for the house. The first configuration
    limited the mass of the PCM to minimize the required changes to a conventional
    cooling system. The main component of the first type of cooling system was the
    integrated PCM evaporator, where a limited amount of PCM was made an integral
    part of the evaporator and placed within an annulus that surrounded the refrigerant
    tube. The system with the integral PCM evaporator showed no potential advantage
    over a conventional system with a larger evaporator and a smaller compressor.
    The system with the integral PCM evaporator also failed to deliver improved energy
    savings and peak load shifting due to insufficient amount of PCM and a significant
    resistance to heat transfer through the PCM within the annulus. In contrast, the
    second configuration for the residential cooling system, which used remotely stored
    PCM, exhibited significant energy savings while shifting the entire peak thermal
    building load to the PCM energy storage with minimal electricity used during the
    peak load. The remote PCM system achieved between a 6 % and a 33 % reduction in
    the required electrical energy for the entire cooling day, depending on the PCM
    thermal resistance, while maintaining acceptable indoor humidity ratios. The performance
    was best when the heat transfer resistance between the PCM and the evaporating
    refrigerant was minimized.
