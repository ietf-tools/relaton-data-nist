abstract:
- content: The Symposium on the Department of Energy's Intermediate Future Forecasting
    System IFFS was held in Washington, D.C. on August 19, 1982. It was funded by
    the Energy Information Administration of The Department of Energy (DOE) and organized
    by the Operations Research Division of the National Bureau of Standards. The purposes
    of the Symposium were (1) to present to the energy community details of DOE's
    new energy market model IFFS and (2) to have an open forum in which IFFS and its
    major elements could be reviewed and critiqued by external experts. DOE speakers
    discussed the total system, its software design, and the modeling aspects of oil
    and gas supply, refineries, electric utilities, coal, and the energy economy.
    Invited experts critiqued each of these topics and offered suggestions for modifications
    and improvement. This volume documents the Proceedings (papers and discussion)
    of the Symposium.
