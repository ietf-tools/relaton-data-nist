- content: The Automated Security Self-Evaluation Tool (ASSET) automates the process
    of completing a system self-assessment. ASSET will assist organizations in completing
    the self-assessment questionnaire contained in NIST Special Publication (Special
    Publication) 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology
    Systems. This technical manual is intended as a development guide for software
    engineers/database administrators who wish to troubleshoot unique installations
    of ASSET, reproduce the development version of ASSET, or extend the functionality
    of ASSET.
