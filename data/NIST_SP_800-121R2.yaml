abstract:
- content: Bluetooth wireless technology is an open standard for short-range radio
    frequency communication used primarily to establish wireless personal area networks
    (WPANs), and has been integrated into many types of business and consumer devices.
    This publication provides information on the security capabilities of Bluetooth
    and gives recommendations to organizations employing Bluetooth wireless technologies
    on securing them effectively. The Bluetooth versions within the scope of this
    publication are versions 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 + Enhanced Data Rate (EDR), 2.1 + EDR,
    3.0 + High Speed (HS), 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2. Versions 4.0 and later support the low
    energy feature of Bluetooth.
