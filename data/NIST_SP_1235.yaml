abstract:
- content: Large outdoor fires have the potential to negatively impact the built environment.
    Wildland fires that spread into communities, known as wildland-urban interface
    (WUI) fires, have become a global problem. Large urban fires, including those
    that have occurred after earthquakes, are another example of large outdoor fires.
    Once a WUI fire reaches a community, a large urban fire may develop. Presentations
    were delivered related to national and regional summaries from across the globe
    of large outdoor fire standards intended to make communities less vulnerable to
    these fires. Understanding from these national and regional summaries will be
    used as a basis for future standardization work on this topic in ISO TC92.
