abstract:
- content: The Association of Public-Safety Communications (APCO), in cooperation
    with FirstNet and the Department of Commerce held a half-day workshop on June
    2, 2015 titled Identifying and Categorizing Data Types for Public Safety Mobile
    Applications. The goal of this workshop was to begin identifying different types
    of data that will flow through applications that operate on the National Public
    Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). A diverse group of first responders, industry
    leaders, and government representatives attended the workshop. This document describes
    the workshop and captures the input received from the workshop attendees.
