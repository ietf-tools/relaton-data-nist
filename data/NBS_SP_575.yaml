abstract:
- content: 'The wall chart ''Design for Better Window Performance'' describes window
    and other design elements and the impact of these design elements singly and in
    combination on window performance and building attributes. The design elements
    are grouped into four categories: Exterior-windbreaks, shades, coverings and sun
    orientation; Frame-insulating frame, opening type, weather strip and hardware;
    Glazing-multi-glazing, reflective glazing, plastic glazing and glass block; Interior-interior
    shading, interior coverings, integral lighting and interior mass. The impacts
    of these design elements are describes in a matrix form and address the following
    window and building attributes: Airtightness, Water tightness, Natural ventilation,
    Insulation, Solar admittance, Daylighting, Visual separation, Acoustical isolation,
    Safety, Access/Egress, Ease of operation, Forced entry resistance, and Durability/Maintenance.
    The chart is designed for ready reference during the design process.'
