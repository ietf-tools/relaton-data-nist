abstract:
- content: Refrigerant working fluids have been predicted to be large contributors
    to the increase in radiative forcing of the earth. Consequently, existing compounds
    will soon be phased out. Low- GWP replacements exist, but they tend to be mildly
    flammable, and there is a need to understand their flammability properties so
    that effective building codes and standards can be written to address their application.
    The burning velocities of interest are in the range of 1 cm/s to 10 cm/s, and
    hence are challenging to measure. To understand the challenges and properties
    of the new agents, experimental measurements and numerical predictions have been
    made for representative refrigerant-air mixtures. Burning velocities were measured
    using a constant pressure spherical chamber with high-speed imaging of the shadowgraph
    image of the propagating spherical flame. The flame propagation rate as a function
    of flame radius was used to estimate the effects of stretch, and to determine
    the un-stretched laminar burning velocity. For comparison, the burning velocity
    was also predicted numerically using a detailed kinetic mechanism for hydrofluorocarbon
    combustion developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
