abstract:
- content: The computation of the elastic shape registration of two simple surfaces
    in 3âˆ’dimensionalspace and therefore of the elastic shape distance between them
    has been investigated by Kurtek, Jermyn, et al. who have proposed algorithms to
    carry out this computation. These algorithms accomplish this by minimizing a distance
    function between the surfaces in terms of rotations and reparametrizations of
    one of the surfaces, the optimization over reparametrizations using a gradient
    approach that may produce a local solution. Now minimizing in terms of rotations
    and a special subset of the set of reparametrizations, we propose an algorithm
    for minimizing the distance function, the optimization over reparametrizations
    based on dynamic programming. This approach does not necessarily produce an optimal
    solution for the registration and distance problem, but perhaps a solution closer
    to optimal than the local solution that an algorithm with a gradient approach
    for optimizing over the entire set of reparametrizations may produce. In fact
    we propose that when computing the elastic shape registration of two simple surfaces
    and the elastic shape distance between them with an algorithm based on a gradient
    approach for optimizing over the entire set of reparametrizations, to use as the
    input initial solution the optimal rotation and reparametrization computed with
    our proposed algorithm.
