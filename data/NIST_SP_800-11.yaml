abstract:
- content: A significant portion of National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP)
    telecommunications relies on the Public Switched Network (PSN). Therefore, NS/EP
    telecommunications is concerned with the protection of the PSN to ensure that
    telecommunications services are available and reliable. Service vendors, equipment
    manufacturers, and the federal government are concerned that vulnerabilities in
    the PSN could be exploited and result in disruptions or degradation of service.
    To address these threats, NIST is assisting the Office of the Manager, National
    Communications System (OMNCS), in the areas of computer and network security research
    and development. NIST is investigating the vulnerabilities and related security
    issues that result from use of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open
    Network Architecture (ONA). This report provides an overview of ONA, describes
    NS/EP telecommunications security concerns, and describes NS/EP telecommunications
    security concerns that the FCC's ONA requirement introduces into the PSN.
