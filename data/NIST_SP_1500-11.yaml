abstract:
- content: The objective of the Advanced Electrical Power Sensors Workshop was to
    provide input into planning processes being undertaken by the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Energy (DOE), and the Grid Modernization
    Laboratory Consortium (GMLC). The workshop provided these entities with the opportunity
    to hear industry concerns and ideas regarding emerging and future electrical power
    system sensors, transducers, and transformer technologies. As the grid continues
    to evolve, and as grid operation and planning support advanced functions, it may
    be necessary to measure aspects of the grid which have not been measured in the
    past, or to refine the way current measurements are performed. This workshop explored
    various means by which grid related activities can be better informed.
