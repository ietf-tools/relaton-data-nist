abstract:
- content: 'This primer provides an overview in using the Manufacturing Cost Guide:
    https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/manufacturing-cost-guide. It
    explains how to use the tool and provides documentation on how the estimates are
    calculated in the tool. Specifically, this tool estimates the costs in U.S. manufacturing,
    which can be used to help gauge the potential returns on manufacturing industry
    research projects. These costs are grouped into various standardized categories
    such as the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and the Standard
    Occupational Classification (SOC) system along with other non-standardized costs.
    Version 1.0 of the tool is providing this information based upon data from 2012
    onward from the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic
    Analysis, and other sources. The tool outputs its results based upon static data
    that is embedded within the tool.'
