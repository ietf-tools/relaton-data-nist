abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a Technical
    Workshop on January 27 and 28, 2021 to assess the state and challenges of a Circular
    Economy (CE) in the High-Tech World. Scientists, researchers, and program managers
    in the CE arena, from industry, academia, government, national laboratories, and
    non-governmental organizations gathered virtually to identify challenges and key
    priorities to facilitate the reuse, repair, and recycling of electronic products,
    solar panels, and batteries. The results of the workshop provide important input
    for program planning and research directions that can advance materials design,
    use, reuse, and recovery, thus enhancing circularity.
