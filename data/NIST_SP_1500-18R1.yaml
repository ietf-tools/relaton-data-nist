abstract:
- content: The NIST Research Data Framework (RDaF) is a multifaceted and customizable
    tool that aims to help shape the future of open data access and research data
    management (RDM). The RDaF will allow organizations and individual researchers
    to customize an RDM strategy. Although NIST is leading the RDaF, most of the content
    in the current v.1.5 was obtained via engagement with national and international
    leaders in the research data community. NIST held a series of three plenary and
    15 stakeholder workshops. Workshop attendees represented all stakeholder sectors,
    from government and academia to industry and non-profits. The audience for the
    RDaF is the entire research data community in all disciplines—the biological,
    chemical, medical, social, and physical sciences. The RDaF is applicable from
    the organization to the project level, encompassing a wide array of job roles
    engaged in activities concerned with research data management, from Executives
    and Chief Data Officers to publishers, funders, and researchers. The RDaF is a
    map of the research data space that uses a lifecycle approach with six high-level
    lifecycle stages to organize key information concerning RDM and research data
    dissemination. Through a community-driven and in-depth process, NIST identified
    specific, high-priority topics and subtopics for each lifecycle stage. The topics
    and subtopics are programmatic and operational activities, concepts, and other
    important factors relevant to RDM. All elements of the RDaF Framework Core—lifecycle
    stages and their associated topics and subtopics—are defined and explained. Further,
    the RDaF team identified Overarching Themes which are pervasive throughout the
    framework core. The core enables organizations and individual researchers to use
    the RDaF for self-assessment of their RDM status. In addition, each subtopic has
    several Informative References—resources such as guidelines standards, and policies.
    As such, the RDaF may be considered a “best practices” document. The RDaF includes
    sample “Profiles,” for various job functions or roles. Each of these profiles
    contains topics and subtopics that an individual in the given job function or
    role needs to consider in fulfilling their RDM responsibilities. Individual researchers
    and organizations involved in the research data lifecycle will be able to tailor
    these profiles for their specific job function. The methodologies used to generate
    the content of this publication are described in detail.
