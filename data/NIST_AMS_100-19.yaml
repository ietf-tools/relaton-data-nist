abstract:
- content: 'The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between mechanical
    and material properties (including density) of manufactured nickel super alloy
    (IN625) using a laser powder bed fusion process and three process parameters:
    laser power, hatch distance, and scan speed. Hardness of the manufactured blocks
    was measured as a representative of the mechanical properties. Density measurements
    were carried out using the pyncometry method. Three sets of blocks were manufactured
    using IN625 metal powder (nitrogen gas atomized) on a laser powder bed fusion
    machine. Different combinations of process parameters yielded different energy
    densities for each block for the three builds. The laser scan speed, laser power,
    hatch distance, and energy density all had statistically significant relationships
    with hardness. The average bulk density increased non-linearly with increasing
    values of energy density. A similar trend was in the hardness data. The results
    of this study served as a guide to determine the range of parameters yielding
    acceptable material properties for the investigation of process parameter sensitivities
    during a subsequent IN625 round robin study.'
