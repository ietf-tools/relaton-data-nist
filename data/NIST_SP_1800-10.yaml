abstract:
- content: 'Today''s manufacturing organizations rely on industrial control systems
    (ICS) to conduct their operations. Increasingly, ICS are facing more frequent,
    sophisticated cyber attacks making manufacturing the second-most-targeted industry.
    Cyber attacks against ICS threaten operations and worker safety, resulting in
    financial loss and harm to the organization''s reputation. The architecture and
    solutions presented in this guide are built upon standards-based, commercially
    available products, and represent some of the possible solutions. The solutions
    implement standard cybersecurity capabilities such as behavioral anomaly detection
    (BAD), application allowlisting (AAL), file integrity-checking, change control
    management, and user authentication and authorization. The solution was tested
    in two distinct lab settings: a discrete manufacturing workcell, which represents
    an assembly line production, and a continuous process control system (PCS), which
    represents chemical manufacturing industries. An organization that is interested
    in protecting the integrity of a manufacturing system and information from destructive
    malware, insider threats, and unauthorized software should first conduct a risk
    assessment and determine the appropriate security capabilities required to mitigate
    those risks. Once the security capabilities are identified, the sample architecture
    and solution presented in this document may be used.'
