abstract:
- content: Operations management systems manage flows of work, resources, and information
    through production and logistics systems, ensuring the correct and efficient execution
    of requested work. These systems can leverage recent advances in data availability,
    analytical capabilities, and industrial automation to substantially improve overall
    system performance. Additional improvements include streamlining flows of work,
    resources, and information across functionally heterogeneous components of production
    and logistics systems, which often have their own planning, execution, and data
    management systems. These smart manufacturing capabilities may simplify system
    implementation and improve its operation. However, they also introduce additional
    complexity to the system and design process. This paper proposes a model of operational
    control capable of supporting an integrated approach to design, analysis, and
    operation across functionally heterogeneous systems, classified as discrete event
    logistics systems. The model identifies and formalizes operational control decision-making
    and actuation functions required by these systems. It then provides logical modeling
    components that can be reused, specialized, and assembled into operational control
    system models. These models can be linked and integrated with other models and
    views of the system as part of an overall model-based engineering effort.
