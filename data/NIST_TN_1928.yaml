abstract:
- content: A series of measurements was made to characterize the structure of a moderate-sized
    methanol pool fire steadily burning in a quiescent environment. Time averaged
    local measurements of temperature and gas species concentrations were made in
    a steadily burning methanol pool fire. Temperatures were measured using fine wire
    thermocouples corrected for radiative losses. Gaseous species were measured using
    extractive sampling through a cooled probe and the samples analyzed using a gas
    chromatograph. The species measured included the reactants (the fuel, methanol,
    and oxygen), combustion intermediates such as CO and combustion products such
    as H2O and CO2. It is anticipated that these data will be useful for model validation.
