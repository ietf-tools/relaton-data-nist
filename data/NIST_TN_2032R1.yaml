abstract:
- content: Building stakeholders need practical metrics, data, and tools to support
    decisions related to sustainable building product selection. The Engineering Laboratory
    of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has addressed this
    national need by developing a new version of its metrics and tools for sustainable
    building products, known as Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability
    (BEES) Online. BEES Online 2 implements the same BEES framework using metrics
    based on process-based life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC)
    approaches to assess the environmental and economic performance of building products.
    BEES Online 2 includes a more user-friendly interface with more expansive user
    customization, options, and guidance. Most products in BEES Online 1.0 (all major
    product categories) as well as new products not in BEES Online 1.0 have been transitioned
    to BEES Online 2, including updating the LCA and LCC results using up-to-date
    methodologies and data sources, with focus on the largest and most widely viewed
    product categories.
