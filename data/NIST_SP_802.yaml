abstract:
- content: The paper is in two parts. In Part I, the SI Green's function is calculated
    and applied to plane-strain problems in cubic solids. In Part II, an extension
    of the Green's function method to the generalized-plane-strain problem is described,
    which enables the calculation of the elastic response of a solid to a prescribed
    out-of-plane strain. It is applied to calculate the stress distribution in a composite
    solid subjected to an out-of-plane load. The final results are in the form of
    an analytical closed integral representation which can be calculated numerically
    as well as analytically. The analytical evaluation of the integral by using the
    contour integration method gives the result in the form of a series. The series
    contains singular as well as non-singular terms. In general, it is difficult to
    ascertain the convergence of the series representation. The analytical series
    representation can be used to identify precisely the nature and the weight of
    each singularity in the stress distribution.
