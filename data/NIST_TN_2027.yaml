abstract:
- content: This report presents the use of a semi-automated commissioning tool for
    the energy retrocommissioning of the Performing Arts Center at Montgomery College
    in Rockville, Maryland. Researchers and field practitioners collaborated to implement
    the HVAC-Cx commissioning software tool in its first full-scale field test. HVAC-Cx
    aids building operators in decision-making by analyzing data using a set of expert
    rules governing the operation of the mechanical equipment. This publically-available
    software program has the capability to communicate with BACnet controllers to
    command the systems under test into their various modes of operation and to record
    system responses to facilitate some of the labor-intensive activities of retro-commissioning.
    These activities included monitoring building data under normal operation (operation
    monitoring) and active testing using a library of prefunctional tests and functional
    performance tests developed to evaluate the performance of both air-side and water-side
    systems. This report presents the results of the commissioning process and examines
    the effectiveness of the HVAC-Cx commissioning tool.
