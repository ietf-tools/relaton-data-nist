abstract:
- content: ASHRAE Guideline 36 High Performance Sequences of Operation for HVAC Systems
    was developed to provide a reference set of high-performance control sequences
    for air-side heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment, including
    multiple-zone variable-air-volume (VAV) air handlers and associated terminal equipment.
    The intent is that high-performance buildings will perform better if well-known
    sequences of operation are specified and controls contractors refine their products
    to correctly implement them. In this work functional performance tests for the
    Guideline 36 sequences were developed and implemented using the HVAC-Cx commissioning
    tool. The HVAC-Cx Functional Performance Test Module was used to commission an
    implementation of Guideline 36 sequences in the NIST Virtual Cybernetic Building
    Testbed. The functional performance tests are described and the effectiveness
    of using the HVAC-Cx tool for detecting faults and implementation errors is evaluated.
