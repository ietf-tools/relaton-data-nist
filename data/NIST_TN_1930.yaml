abstract:
- content: Due to the significant life-safety and economic loss resulting from extreme,
    low probability, high consequence weather events such as Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane
    Sandy, and the Joplin tornado, greater focus has been placed on increasing the
    resiliency of buildings to decrease these impacts. Investigations of building
    performance following tornadoes and hurricanes have shown that wind-borne debris,
    including loose aggregate, gravel, and stone surfacing on roofs are significant
    contributors to building damage and occupant injuries. Buildings may often experience
    little to no structural damage, but suffer failure of exterior glazing, causing
    catastrophic damage to building interiors and building contents that can also
    result in injuries and fatalities. A recent proposed code change to the International
    Building Code (IBC) would prohibit installation of loose aggregate surfacing on
    roofs of Risk Category III or IV buildings located in the most tornado-prone region
    of the country (covering portions of the Great Plains, Midwest, and Deep South)
    in order to reduce the wind-borne debris hazard, particularly to glazed openings.
    Existing building codes already have provisions prohibiting the use of roof aggregate
    to reduce wind-borne debris hazards in hurricane-prone regions (IBC 2015, Section
    1504.8), and expansion of similar provisions in the tornado-prone region are those
    currently being considered. However, the economic impacts of these proposed code
    changes to prohibit the use of roof aggregate in tornado-prone regions are not
    currently well understood. Needed is an assessment of the impacted building stock
    and the magnitude of associated costs. The purpose of this study is to analyze
    the potential economic impacts from adoption of this proposed change to the IBC
    by identifying the fraction of roof construction that could be impacted from the
    restriction on aggregate surfaced roofs, characterizing alternatives to aggregate-surfaced
    roofing systems, and estimating the costs associated with these alternative roofing
    systems. The results are presented using both a national and regional perspective,
    including a comparison of the impacts from the restrictions on aggregate in the
    hurricane-prone regions. The results demonstrate that the code change would potentially
    impact less than 0.1 % of all roof construction in the U.S., and less than 3.0
    % of all non-low rise residential roof construction in the tornado-prone region.
    This includes roofs of newly constructed buildings and reroofing projects. The
    previously adopted code change that similarly prohibited aggregate-surfaced roofs
    in the hurricane-prone region impacted more than four times as much roof construction.
    It is found that few roof construction projects will be negatively impacted from
    a construction cost perspective by the proposed restriction on aggregate in the
    tornado-prone region (<0.2 %) because cost-effective alternatives are available
    for most assemblies. Common types of aggregate-surfaced roofing that would be
    prohibited under the proposed code change can be more expensive than similar alternatives.
    For example, built-up roofs with aggregate surfacing are found to cost more than
    the alternative system that replaces the aggregate with a cap sheet. For single-ply
    roof systems over a steel roof deck, aggregate ballasted EPDM is also found to
    be more expensive than mechanically attached EPDM. Only in the case of the single-ply
    systems over a concrete roof deck are aggregate ballasted EPDM systems found to
    be less expensive than the alternative EPDM systems. These results hold for all
    33 cities studied within the tornado-prone region.
