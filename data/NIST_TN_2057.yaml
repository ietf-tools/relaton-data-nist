abstract:
- content: In this study, we elongated glass-fiber model composites in tension to
    monitor local fiber breakage in the epoxy matrix under quasi-static loading (approximately
    0.00001 s-1) and high rate loading (approximately 200 s-1). Strains for the initial
    fiber breaks were around 2 % under the quasi-static loading, while the strains
    for the initial fiber breaks were around 4 % to 5 % for the high strain rate loading,
    indicating significant rate dependent characteristics on tensile failure strains
    of the glass fibers.
