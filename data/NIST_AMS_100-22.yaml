abstract:
- content: The ninth installment of the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) Summit was hosted
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on April 2-5, 2018.
    The MBE Summit 2018 witnessed another year-over-year registration growth. This
    speaks to the growing interest of MBE within the community and the importance
    of the Summit output. The MBE Summit 2018 Program Committee undertook a significant
    effort to ensure a high-quality summit and signal to the community that the MBE
    Summit is the best place for gathering and sharing information dedicated to the
    digital transformation across the product lifecycle. The MBE Summit 2018 focused
    on empowering the industrial shift to MBE with recommended practices and how-to
    guidance. The MBE Summit 2018 theme was Empowering the Digital Transformation
    with an Integrated Lifecycle, with technical tracks spanning across Systems Engineering
    and Lifecycle Management, Design Recommended Practice and Model-Based Definition,
    Model-Based Manufacturing, and Model-Based Quality and Inspection. The MBE Summit
    had 70 submissions for presentation, of which the Program Committee accepted eight
    papers, 33 presentations, five posters, and two panels. This report is the proceedings
    of the MBE Summit 2018.
