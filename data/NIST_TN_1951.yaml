abstract:
- content: Radio frequency (RF) propagation measurements were conducted at three facilities
    representing a cross-section of different classes of industrial environments.
    Selected sites included a multi-acre transmission assembly factory typical of
    the automotive industry; a medium-sized machine shop primarily engaged in metalworking
    located on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg; and a steam generation plant located
    on the NIST campus in Boulder. A spread spectrum correlation sounder was used
    to take the measurements at a continuum of points throughout the facility by fixing
    the transmitter and moving the receiver at a constant rate throughout each facility.
    We analyzed the data collected from the RF propagation measurements of each site.
    Analysis is based on channel impulse response (CIR) measurements collected during
    the measurement using equipment developed by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology. The results of our analysis includes a tabulated summary and detailed
    exploration of various industry accepted channel metrics such as path loss, delay
    spread, and K factor. Our interpretation of the measurements contributes to an
    improved understanding of radio frequency propagation in factories and an additional
    perspective on deploying wireless communication devices within factories. The
    raw measurement data and analysis software is made freely available for public
    download.
