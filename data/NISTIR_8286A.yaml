abstract:
- content: This document supplements NIST Interagency or Internal Report 8286, Integrating
    Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), by providing additional detail
    regarding risk guidance, identification, and analysis. This report offers examples
    and information to illustrate risk tolerance, risk appetite, and methods for determining
    risks in that context. To support the development of an Enterprise Risk Register,
    this report describes documentation of various scenarios based on the potential
    impact of threats and vulnerabilities on enterprise assets. Documenting the likelihood
    and impact of various threat events through cybersecurity risk registers integrated
    into an enterprise risk profile helps to later prioritize and communicate enterprise
    cybersecurity risk response and monitoring.
