abstract:
- content: First responders today can leverage large quantities of multimedia data
    from a variety of sources within and outside their agencies, and the scope of
    this data sharing is growing rapidly. This expansion in capabilities comes with
    several technical challenges, such as the need for new interoperability standards
    and software tools that can make sense of the deluge of data. But many of the
    challenges facing public safety agencies using or considering implementing such
    technologies are not primarily technical in nature. In areas of governance, policy,
    and funding, new data sharing technologies exacerbate existing obstacles, such
    as resource limitations, and create new ones, such as legal risks of cybersecurity
    vulnerabilities. Through an analysis of responses to structured interviews with
    first responders across the United States, we summarize the key non-technical
    challenges facing public safety use of emerging data sharing technologies. Based
    on the experiences and concerns shared by these first responders, we conclude
    that addressing these challenges with research and development on technical solutions
    may help ensure that these technologies deliver maximum benefit for emergency
    response applications.
