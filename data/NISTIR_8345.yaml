abstract:
- content: This report details the second annual, full-day workshop exploring the
    metrology necessary for repeatably and independently assessing the performance
    of robotic systems in real-world human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. This
    workshop continues the motion toward bridging the gaps between the theory and
    applications of HRI, enabling reproducible studies in HRI, and accelerating the
    adoption of cutting-edge technologies as the industry state-of-practice. The second
    annual workshop, 'Test Methods and Metrics for Effective HRI', seeks to identify
    test methods and metrics for the holistic assessment and assurance of HRI performance
    in practical applications. The focus is on identifying the key performance indicators
    of seemingly disparate sectors, and to foster the community based on the principles
    of transparency, repeatability and reproducibility, and establishing trust. The
    goal is to aid in the advancement of HRI technologies through the development
    of experimental design, test methods, and metrics for assessing HRI and interface
    designs.
