abstract:
- content: This report quantifes the accuracy of passive face presentation attack
    detection (PAD) algorithms (software only, no hardware solutions) operating on
    conventional 2D imagery of various presentation attack instruments (PAI). The
    algorithms were submitted to the Presentation Attack Detection track of the Face
    Analysis Technology Evaluation (FATE) executed by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST).
