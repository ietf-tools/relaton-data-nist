abstract:
- content: State levels are a fundamental waveform parameter that are essential for
    the computation of most other waveform parameters. The histogram-mode method has
    been the mainstay for the estimation of state level and the shorth method was
    introduced as a potentially more accurate estimator. A comparison of the errors
    and measurement uncertainties in the values of state level that are computed using
    the histogram-mode method and the shorth method are presented. The effects of
    noise and aberrations in this comparison are included. The performance of these
    methods depends on the types and magnitude of the noise and aberrations.
