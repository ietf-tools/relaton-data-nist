abstract:
- content: 'This document updates and replaces NISTIR 8161. This revised recommendation
    continues to focus on storing metadata to support video analytics. At the FBI''s
    request, NIST conducted research and developed NISTIR 8161 as a recommendation
    to address the FBI''s minimum interoperability requirements for the exporting
    and exchange of video recordings captured by closed circuit television (CCTV)
    digital video recording (DVR) systems. NIST termed these requirements ''Level
    0''. Subsequently, NIST shared its findings and recommendations with video industry
    hardware and software manufacturers, and the relevant standards community. This
    led to NIST collaborating with the Open Network Video Interface Forum (ONVIF)
    to enhance their Export File Format Specification to support the essential functionality
    of NISTIR 8161. Working with ONVIF has improved the likelihood of industry''s
    adaptation to law enforcement requirements. Additionally, ONVIF contributed its
    Export File Format Specification to the International Electrotechnical Commission
    (IEC) for inclusion in IEC 62676-2-32, Video surveillance systems for use in security
    applications - Part 2-32: Recording control and replay based on web services (expected
    publication mid-2019). NIST recommends industry implementation of the ONVIF and
    IEC standards noted above. These standards provide acceptable alternative implementation
    approaches to what NIST proposed in NISTIR 8161 for recording and storing time
    information. The standards also provide additional useful capabilities including
    the recording of additional metadata and a means to ensure data integrity and
    chain of custody using a digital signature. The recommendations provided in this
    document are intended to support law enforcement investigations. This document
    was prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in
    collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and in conjunction
    with the CCTV / DVR community.'
