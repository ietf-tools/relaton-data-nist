abstract:
- content: This report documents the U.S. federal agencies use of foreign patents,
    in addition to U.S. patents, to protect the intellectual property for inventions
    created in their laboratories. The report describes the extent of U.S. and foreign
    patents in the patent portfolios of the U.S. federal agencies, and it describes
    the process of licensing of the agencies patented inventions. A dynamic panel
    data model is estimated for each agency s invention-license revenues as a function
    of the history of its applications and granted patents. The evidence supports
    the view that an agency that obtains U.S. patents for its inventions but does
    not obtain foreign patent protection may reduce the value of licenses to use the
    technologies. Value for the licensee may be reduced because the corporations that
    license the agency s technologies may face international competition from firms
    that copy those technologies and compete with lower costs because they do not
    incur full development costs or pay royalties for licensing the technologies.
    The report estimates the agencies benefits, in terms of licensing revenues, and
    costs for obtaining foreign-patent protection for their U.S.-patented inventions.
    The report provides detailed case studies of the licensing and commercialization
    of two federal-agency technologies.
