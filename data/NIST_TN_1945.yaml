abstract:
- content: In recent years the IETF has been making a range of efforts to secure the
    email infrastructure and its use. Infrastructure protection includes source authentication
    by RFC 7208 Sender Policy Framework (SPF), message integrity authentication by
    RFC 6376 Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), and domain owner feedback on the
    effectiveness of these methods by RFC 7489 Domain- based Message Authentication,
    Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). The High Assurance Domains (HAD) secure email
    project at NIST has been supporting the development of these initiatives by developing
    and deploying test infrastructure. This report describes our cumulative experiences
    with a test system for DMARC and its related protocols.
