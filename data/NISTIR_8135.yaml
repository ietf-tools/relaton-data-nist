abstract:
- content: The Association of Public-Safety Communications (APCO), in cooperation
    with FirstNet and the Department of Commerce held a half-day workshop on June
    2, 2015, Identifying and Categorizing Data Types for Public Safety Mobile Applications.
    The goal of this workshop was to begin identifying different types of data that
    will flow through applications that operate on the National Public Safety Broadband
    Network (NPSBN). A diverse group of first responders, industry leaders, and government
    representatives attended the workshop. This document describes the workshop and
    captures the input received from the workshop attendees.
