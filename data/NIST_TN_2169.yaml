abstract:
- content: Twenty-one W24 hot-rolled columns of ASTM A992 steel with five different
    sections were tested in Phase 1 of this research program to investigate the effects
    of slenderness parameters, constant axial load levels, lateral drift loading sequences,
    and weak-axis bending on the column base responses. It was observed that the webs
    of these sections with much larger ℎ/ �������� ratios were not as effective in
    restraining and delaying flange local buckling as those of shallow and stocky
    (e.g., W12 or W14) columns. Specimens with sections that satisfied the highly
    ductile requirement in the AISC Seismic Provisions still experienced significant
    damage and axial shortening due to the interactive flange and web local buckling.
    An unusual failure mode with local buckling coupled with lateral-torsional buckling
    was also observed for the first time. Based on these tests results, observed buckling
    modes were classified, and a simplified procedure to predict the governing buckling
    mode was proposed. Additional 23 columns including W14, W18, W24, and W30 sections
    were tested to further evaluate the effects of section depths, boundary conditions,
    and varying axial loads. Test results revealed that findings from Phase 1 testing
    could be extrapolated to deeper and shallower sections; the proposed procedure
    predicted very well the buckling mode of Phase 2 specimens. Allowing the column
    top end to rotate increased the story drift capacity but did not change the buckling
    mode. Results from varying axial load tests showed that first-story exterior columns
    behave very differently from the interior ones. W14 column test results showed
    that classifying a column as deep or shallow based on the nominal section depth
    may be inappropriate; the deep column phenomenon with significant interactive
    local buckling could develop in W14 columns with relatively slender web and flanges.
