abstract:
- content: This report develops an approach to evaluate the direct and indirect impacts
    from wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires that result in the loss of functionality
    of the built environment, for a regional economy. While direct losses from WUI
    fires are largely observable, needed is a mechanism to evaluate how these indirectly
    affect other sectors of the economy. The approach is designed to quantify the
    total impacts (both direct and indirect) from WUI fire due to a loss of functionality
    of assets (e.g., structures) directly impacted in a regional economy, and provides
    a mechanism to systematically quantify the interplay between direct and indirect
    economic impacts. The use of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model allows
    for simulation of various possible economic shocks resulting from the temporary
    or permanent loss of the built environment. It also allows for behavioral changes
    of the local population due to fire risk (e.g., changes in preferences). The output
    from such an approach will facilitate a better understanding of the potential
    vulnerabilities within a community. For example, the approach will identify thresholds
    of functionality that if exceeded would result in catastrophic loss. In addition,
    simulation of risk mitigation scenarios (allowing for a resilience in functionality)
    could be used to determine optimal intervention strategies. Combined with intervention
    cost data and cost-effective risk mitigation strategies could be identified.
