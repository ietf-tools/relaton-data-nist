abstract:
- content: The proliferation of advanced data sharing technologies and the emergence
    of a national public safety broadband network (NPSBN) are revolutionizing the
    communications capabilities of first responders in the United States. Fire departments,
    law enforcement agencies, emergency medical service providers, and other public
    safety entities are beginning to adopt messaging applications, sensors, networked
    cameras, and other technologies that provide a wealth of real- time information
    about people, infrastructure, and the incident environment. However, the rapid
    expansion of these technologies presents important technical, economic, and governance
    challenges that need to be addressed for these technologies to provide interoperable
    communication solutions for all members of the public safety community. This report
    provides an overview of these challenges, focusing on data exchange standards,
    data access control approaches, and data sharing policy frameworks. It explores
    the limitations of efforts to improve the interoperability of data sharing technologies
    to date and provides recommendations for the public safety community to leverage
    existing resources and organizations and build new alliances to promote a more
    interoperable future for data sharing technologies. The report is intended to
    inform and motivate public safety leaders to create the conditions that will allow
    first responders to derive maximum operational benefits from the capabilities
    provided by emerging technologies and the NPSBN, and to encourage technology developers
    to support more interoperable data sharing technologies for public safety.
