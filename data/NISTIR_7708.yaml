abstract:
- content: 'The National Status and Trends (NS&T) Program, was initiated in 1984 by
    the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to address concerns
    about the condition of the Nation''s coastal and estuarine ecosystems1,2. This
    Program consists of the National Benthic Surveillance (established in 1984) and
    Mussel Watch, one of the longest (inaugural year, 1986) nation-wide continuous
    contaminant monitoring programs in U.S. coastal waters3. The goal of the NS&T
    Program is to quantify current status and long-term trends in concentrations of
    selected contaminants in biological indicator organisms and environmental matrices
    of coastal and estuarine areas in the U.S.2 In the initial years of the Program,
    benthic fish, shellfish, sediment, and bivalve tissue were collected on a regular
    basis for real-time chemical analysis from sites along the U.S. In addition to
    real-time analysis and monitoring of these materials, the Program collects samples
    of mussels and oysters for long-term banking and future retrospective analyses.
    Due to a decrease in funding, specimen banking for the Program ended in 1992;
    however specimen banking for the Mussel Watch portion resumed in 20054. Each collection
    year, approximately 10% of the samples that are collected from Mussel Watch sites
    are archived at one of two specimen bank facilities operated by the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST)5: the National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank
    (NBSB), established in 1987, located on the main NIST campus in Gaithersburg,
    Maryland, and the Marine Environmental Specimen Bank (Marine ESB), established
    in 1998, located at the Hollings Marine Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina.
    This report describes the program history, and the detailed collection, processing,
    and long-term storage protocols practiced by NIST''s Environmental Specimen Banking
    System for Mussel Watch.'
