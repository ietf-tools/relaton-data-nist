abstract:
- content: 'In September 2014, the Applied Technology Council (ATC) commenced a task
    order project under National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Contract
    SB1341-13-CQ-0009 to develop guidance for nonlinear dynamic analysis (ATC-114
    Project). The need for such guidance is identified as high-priority research and
    development topic (Proposed Research Initiative 6) in NIST GCR 14-917-27 report,
    Nonlinear Analysis Research and Development Program for Performance-Based Seismic
    Engineering (NIST, 2013), which outlines a research and development program for
    addressing the gap between state-of-the-art academic research and state-of-practice
    engineering applications for nonlinear structural analysis, analytical structural
    modeling, and computer simulation in support of performance-based seismic engineering.
    In addition, the NIST GCR 09-917-2 report, Research Required to Support Full Implementation
    of Performance-Based Seismic Design (NIST, 2009), also identified the need to
    improve analytical models for buildings and their components in near-collapse
    seismic loading. To help fill this gap, the ATC-114 Project developed a series
    of reports that provide general nonlinear modeling and nonlinear analysis guidance,
    as well as guidance specific to the following two structural systems: structural
    steel moment frames and reinforced concrete moment frames. This Part I Guidelines
    document is the first in the series and provides general guidance. The companion
    Part II Guidelines (NIST GCR 17-917-46v2 and 17-917-46v3) provide further details
    for steel moment frame and reinforced moment frame systems, respectively. It is
    envisioned that these Guidelines will be used in conjunction with available performance-assessment
    provisions, or their equivalent, that are appropriate for the specific circumstances.'
