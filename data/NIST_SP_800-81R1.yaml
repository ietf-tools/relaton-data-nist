abstract:
- content: This document provides deployment guidelines for securing the Domain Name
    System (DNS) in any enterprise a government agency or a corporate entity. The
    deployment guidelines follow from an analysis of security objectives and consequent
    protection approaches for all DNS components. This document was originally published
    in May 2006. Since then the following IETF RFCs , FIPS and NIST Cryptographic
    guidance documents have been published and this revision takes into account the
    specifications and recommendations found in those documents - DNNSEC Operational
    Practices (RFC 4641), Automated Updates for DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors
    (RFC 5011), DNS Security (DNSSEC)Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence (RFC
    5155), HMAC SHA TSIG Algorithm Identifiers (RFC 4635), The Keyed-Hash Message
    Authentication Code (HMAC) (FIPS 198-1), Digital Signature Standard (FIPS 186-3)
    and Recommendations for Key Management (SP 800-57P1 & SP 800-57P3). In addition
    this revision provides illustrations of Secure configuration examples using DNS
    Software offering NSD, in addition to BIND, guidelines on Procedures for migrating
    to a new Cryptographic Algorithm for signing of the Zone (Section 11.5), guidelines
    for Procedures for migrating to NSEC3 specifications from NSEC for providing authenticated
    denial of existence (Section 11.6) and deployment guidelines for Split-Zone under
    different scenarios (Section 11.7).
