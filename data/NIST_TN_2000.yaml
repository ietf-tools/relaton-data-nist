abstract:
- content: 'This report presents the software DAD_ESWL v1.0 capable of computing efficiently
    the response to wind of mid- and high-rise structures consisting of up to thousands
    of members. The report also documents the following features of the software:
    (1) Use of the Database-Assisted Design (DAD) procedure or of the Equivalent Static
    Wind Load (ESWL) procedure for the iterative structural design of mid- and high-rise
    buildings. (2) Incorporation into the design of second-order elastic analysis
    (both P-? member chord rotation, and P-? member curvature). DAD_ESWL uses a geometric
    stiffness method allowing the second-order effects to be accounted for with no
    iterations. (3) Improvements in the graphical user interface, including: (i) definition
    of pressure tap locations, (ii) pressure distribution displays, (iii) calculation
    of floor wind loads due to pressures at taps, and (iv) use of MATLAB tools enabling
    free editing of displays of computation results. (4) Updates of steel member interaction
    formulas applicable to various types of beam-column joints, bracing connection
    details, and cross-sectional shapes. (5) Generation of biaxial interaction strength
    surface for determining the demand-to-capacity indexes of reinforced concrete
    columns or shear walls with rectangular cross section specified by the user. The
    demand-to-capacity index for the shear wall can be calculated as well. (6) Inclusion
    of the capability to use OpenSees for the efficient calculation of modal shapes
    and frequencies of vibration, as well as of influence coefficients. The report
    includes a detailed user''s manual.'
