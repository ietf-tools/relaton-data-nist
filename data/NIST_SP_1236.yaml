abstract:
- content: 'The kickoff workshop of the new permanent working group, sponsored by
    the International Association for Fire Safety Science (IAFSS), entitled Large
    Outdoor Fires and the Built Environment was held from 3:00 pm to 4:30 pm on Sunday
    October 21, 2018. The workshop was held as a part of the 11th Asia-Oceania Symposium
    on Fire Science and Technology (AOSFST) in Taipei, Taiwan. The working group is
    co-led by Sara McAllister of the U.S. Forest Service (unable to come to Taiwan),
    Sayaka Suzuki of National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster, and Samuel
    L. Manzello of NIST''s Engineering Laboratory. The IAFSS permanent working group
    consists of three subgroups, with subleaders appointed by Manzello, McAllister,
    and Suzuki, and these are prioritized into the following topics: Ignition Resistant
    Communities (IRC, led by Elsa Pastor, UPC, unable to come to Taiwan), Emergency
    Management and Evacuation (EME, led by Enrico Ronchi, Lund University, unable
    to come to Taiwan), and Large Outdoor Firefighting (LOFF, led by Raphaele Blanchi,
    CSIRO). The IRC subgroup is focused on developing the scientific basis for new
    standard testing methodologies indicative of large outdoor fire exposures, including
    the development of necessary testing methodologies to characterize wildland fuel
    treatments adjacent to communities. The EME subgroup is focused on developing
    the scientific basis for effective emergency management strategies for communities
    exposed to large outdoor fires. The LOFF subgroup is providing a review of various
    tactics that are used, as well as the various personal protective equipment (PPE),
    and suggest pathways for research community engagement, including environmental
    issues in suppressing these fires. The overall objectives are to bring the full
    depth of knowledge of the IAFSS community to work on these priority topics. At
    the kickoff workshop, detailed ideas were presented regarding the planned activities
    of the working group, especially the large workshop to be held at IAFSS 2020.'
