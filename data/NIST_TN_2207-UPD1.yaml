abstract:
- content: Image segmentation is the first step in a complex process of object recognition.
    This report presents a method to gauge the difficulty of segmentation by calculating
    a scalar parameter Q for an image. This parameter depends on a distribution of
    the intensity of the grayscale image and the distribution of the clustering of
    pixels. It is assumed that images with a smaller number of clusters are easier
    to segment than images with a large number of clusters. Since segmentation precedes
    any human perception and categorization, the distribution of parameter Q introduced
    in this study may be useful in characterizing the variability of images collected
    in a training database for the development of object recognition algorithms which
    use Machine Learning (ML) methods. Parameter Q can be especially useful for building
    a representative dataset of images for training ML algorithms. To demonstrate
    a link between particular values of Q and different segmentation conditions, a
    few grayscale images were distorted by some common transformations (like Gaussian
    noise, median filtering, reduction in grayscale) and the corresponding values
    of parameter Q were calculated. To demonstrate a possible use of the parameter
    Q on data other than grayscale images, depth images of flat planar targets taken
    by two depth cameras were also processed.
