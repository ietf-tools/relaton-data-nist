abstract:
- content: Environmental concerns are driving regulations to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons
    (HFCs) with high global warming potential (GWP) as refrigerants in heat pumps.
    CO2 is an attractive alternative refrigerant because is it environmentally friendly
    in terms of direct emissions, with GWP=1, and no ozone depletion potential (ODP).
    However, CO2 heat pumps generally have a lower efficiency than HFC-based systems,
    and therefore have higher indirect emissions, related to generating the electricity
    that powers them. The indirect emissions dwarf the direct emissions for most heating,
    air-conditioning and refrigeration applications, so it is critical for the equipment
    to operate with high efficiency. CO2 air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) provide cooling
    with particularly low efficiency at high ambient temperatures where the CO2 operates
    in a transcritical cycle. Using CO2 in a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) offers
    the potential to overcome the low efficiency since a GSHP operates with lower
    heat-rejection temperature (for cooling), enabling the system to operate some
    of the time in a more-efficient subcritical cycle. This report details the laboratory
    tests of a prototype residential liquid-to-air ground-source air conditioner (GSAC)
    using CO2 as the refrigerant. The tests were performed in an environmental chamber
    and followed the ISO 13256-1 standard for rating GSHPs. The CO2 GSAC operated
    either in a subcritical or a transcritical cycle, depending on the entering liquid
    temperature (ELT). The test results included the coefficient of performance (COP),
    capacity, sensible heat ratio (SHR), and pressures. The system incorporated a
    liquid-line/suction-line heat exchanger (LLSL-HX), which was estimated to cause
    a COP penalty of (0 to 2) % for ELTs ranging (10 to 25) [degrees]C, and benefit
    of (0 to 5) % for ELTs ranging (30 to 39) [degrees]C. The CO2 system was compared
    to a low-cost , commercially-available R410A-based GSHP. With ELTs ranging (10
    to 39) [degrees]C the CO2 system cooling COP ranged (7.3 to 2.4), whereas the
    R410A system values ranged (6.1 to 3.2). At the standard rating condition (ELT
    25 [degrees]C), the CO2 GSAC cooling COP was 4.14 and the R410A GSHP COP was 4.57.
    At part-load conditions (ELT 20 [degrees]C) both systems had a COP of ?4.92. Further
    effort is needed to increase the CO2 system efficiency at ELTs greater than 20
    [degrees]C, since it underperformed the R410A system in that temperature range.
