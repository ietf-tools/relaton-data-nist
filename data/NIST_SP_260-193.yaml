abstract:
- content: Reference Material (RM) 8634 is a NIST particle standard produced from
    abraded ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), a chemically inert polymer, that
    will help standardize and allow more accurate monitoring of subvisible proteinaceous
    particles in biotherapeutics. These ETFE particles resemble proteinaceous particles
    in biotherapeutics because they are translucent, with a refractive index similar
    to that of proteinaceous particles and have irregular morphology. RM 8634 has
    reference values for particle size distribution (PSD), in the range of (1 to 30)
    ?m, and morphology (aspect ratio, compactness, ellipse ratio). The PSD values
    were obtained using flow imaging (FI), an in-house-devised stop-flow microscope
    (SFM), and a static optical microscopic technique. For morphological assessment
    of the particles, SFM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and static optical
    microscopy techniques were employed. All techniques employed were highly characterized
    for instrument biases and appropriate corrections were made; rigorous statistical
    analysis of the data was performed to obtain the reference values. This document
    briefly describes the preparation of the RM, data collection, data analysis, data
    compilation, and reference value assignment. Detailed procedures of how the analyst
    can use this RM to obtain PSD and morphology information, qualify instruments,
    reduce variability, and correct for instrument biases are presented. The document
    also describes how the analyst will be able to apply corrections, obtained from
    RM analysis, to protein-like samples to obtain more accurate PSD and morphology
    information than if the correction is based solely on polystyrene microspheres.
    Such a standard is the first-of-its-kind available to the industry. We envision
    that RM 8634 will drive industrial collaboration to better characterize and in
    turn, understand the implications of proteinaceous particles in biotherapeutics.
