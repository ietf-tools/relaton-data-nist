abstract:
- content: 'NIST Handbook 150-2, 2016 edition, presents the technical requirements
    and guidance for the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary
    Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Calibration Laboratories Program. The
    2016 edition of NIST Handbook 150-2 supersedes and replaces the following handbooks:
    150-2A:2004, 150-2B:2004, 150-2C:2001, 150-2D:2004, 150-2E:2001, 150-2F:2003,
    150-2G:2004, and 150-2H:2004. The 2016 edition consolidates several technical
    guidance documents in the NIST Handbook 150-2 series into one document with a
    set of normative annexes, including: Annex A which addresses the general accreditation
    requirements prescribed in ANSI/NCSL Z540-1-1994, Calibration Laboratories and
    Measuring and Test Equipment General Requirements, Part I, that are not directly
    addressed in ISO/IEC 17025:2005; Annex B which sets out technical requirements
    not covered in NIST Handbook 150 that are applicable to a laboratory recognized
    as competent to carry out dimensional calibrations; Annex C which sets out technical
    requirements not covered in NIST Handbook 150 that are applicable to a laboratory
    recognized as competent to carry out time and frequency calibrations. Additional
    annexes covering the remaining fields of calibration will be published upon the
    completion of their review and updating. The annexes form a normative part of
    this handbook, meaning they contain provisions that laboratories must meet in
    order to conform to the requirements for accreditation. Calibration laboratories
    use NIST Handbook 150-2 in developing the management and technical systems that
    govern their operations. Laboratory customers, regulatory authorities, and accreditation
    bodies may also use it as a basis upon which to judge the competence of laboratories.'
