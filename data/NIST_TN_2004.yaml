abstract:
- content: Engineered nanoparticles (ENP) are being used in many applications including
    consumer products. There are many different means by which ENPs may be incorporated
    into these products (freely- dispersed, embedded, reactive or passive) which can
    impact the potential for consumer exposure to ENPs. This study was motivated by
    the desire to better understand inhalation exposure to ENPs, and this report addresses
    airborne ENPs that could affect indoor air quality (IAQ). Occupant exposure to
    airborne nanoparticles can be characterized by indoor airflow and contaminant
    transport analysis models. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
    is working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop
    modeling tools to enable evaluation of consumer exposure to airborne ENPs in the
    built environment. NIST has developed two tools, the first is an online tool that
    provides estimates of indoor exposure to airborne particles. This first tool,
    referred to as the single-size particle tool, is based on the NIST multizone modeling
    software, CONTAM, and demonstrates some of the capabilities that an aerosol exposure
    assessment tool should entail. The second tool, referred to as the size-resolved
    tool, includes additional physical models that account for the properties of nanoparticles
    that may impact their transport within the built environment including some beyond
    those that CONTAM is currently capable of modeling, e.g., coagulation. This report
    describes the development and application of these two analysis tools that could
    provide the basis of modeling consumer exposure to ENPs for future development.
