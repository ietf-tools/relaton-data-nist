abstract:
- content: A series of field experiments was conducted to examine the effects on fire
    spread toward a structure for firewood piles under conditions that may be encountered
    in a wildland-urban interface (WUI) fire. The fire behavior of a variety of firewood
    types in multiple configurations was studied under various wind conditions. The
    62 experiments conducted included long range firebrand travel and mitigation experiments.
    Wood types included kiln-dried oak, maple, pine, and undried oak. Configuration
    variations included woodpile height, orientation, and elevation on a rack. A wind
    machine provided a mean wind speed between 6 m/s and 14 m/s (13 mi/h to 31 mi/h).
    The woodpiles were ignited by a propane burner on the ground at the end farthest
    from a small structure located between 0 m and 7.32 m (0 ft to 24 ft) downwind
    of the woodpile. A target mulch bed at the base of the structure tested the ability
    of firebrands produced by the burning woodpile to ignite spot fires that threatened
    the structure. The experiments in this study demonstrated that firewood piles
    can be rapid sources of spot fire ignitions and can easily spread fire to nearby
    structures. Rapid fire growth on and substantial flames from the woodpiles were
    found for all wood types and configurations. Fire behavior was classified as mostly
    high with medium hazard for only the lowest wind condition. In all cases, spot
    fire generation was affected by the wind field; the structure created both upward
    flow (enhanced by buoyancy) and a vortex that deposited firebrands next to the
    structure. During all experiments, the burning woodpile produced firebrands that
    ignited spot fires in the target mulch bed. In long range experiments, firebrands
    from a woodpile caused ignitions over 26 m (85 ft) downwind. This study of the
    fire hazard of woodpiles is part of a series designed to better inform standards
    and codes regarding placement of landscape features around homes that are at risk
    of exposure to wildland-urban interface fires.
