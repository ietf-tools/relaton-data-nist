abstract:
- content: RP 10 allows federal agencies to identify conditions in an existing building
    that may pose unacceptable seismic risks to the agency in case of undesirable
    performance of the building during an earthquake. Agency exposure to unacceptable
    risks is generally determined through a seismic evaluation and risk assessment
    of the building. RP 10 provides triggers for a seismic evaluation for project
    circumstances such as major alterations, additions, or repairs, as well as change
    of use or leasing requirements. Evaluation necessitated by triggers is referred
    to as the mandatory process. RP 10 additionally addresses risk awareness by having
    agencies proactively implement evaluations based on inventory screening, which
    is independent of passive trigger requirements identified in the mandatory process.
    This process is referred to as the screening process. RP 10 provides circumstances
    to assist an agency in developing a screening process. RP 10 also identifies buildings
    exempt from seismic evaluation. RP 10 provides the minimum seismic performance
    objective for evaluation of existing buildings owned or leased by the Federal
    Government. The basic performance objective is based on risk to occupant safety
    in a large, rare earthquake by total or partial collapse of the building. Higher
    performance objectives are provided that can be used to assess the risks of loss
    of operative systems, extended re-occupancy and recovery time, or economic losses.
    RP 10 references model building codes published by the International Code Council
    as well as national consensus standards published by the American Society of Civil
    Engineers to provide the basis for defining seismic performance objectives, evaluation
    procedures, and, where necessary, retrofit criteria.
