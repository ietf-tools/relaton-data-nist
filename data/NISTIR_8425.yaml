abstract:
- content: This publication documents the consumer profile of NIST's Internet of Things
    (IoT) core baseline and identifies cybersecurity capabilities commonly needed
    for the consumer IoT sector (i.e., IoT products for home or personal use). It
    can also be a starting point for businesses to consider in the purchase of IoT
    products. The consumer profile was developed as part of NIST's response to Executive
    Order 14028 and was initially published in Recommended Criteria for Cybersecurity
    Labeling for Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) Products. The consumer profile
    capabilities are phrased as cybersecurity outcomes that are intended to apply
    to the entire IoT product. This document also discusses the foundations for developing
    the recommended consumer profile and related considerations. NIST reviewed a landscape
    of relevant source documents to inform the consumer profile and engaged with stakeholders
    across a year-long effort to develop the recommendations.
