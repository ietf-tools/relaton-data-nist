abstract:
- content: NIST's Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division is the primary
    federal laboratory focused on conducting research, development, testing, and evaluation
    for public safety communications technologies. Their mission is to accelerate
    communications innovation in support of public safety communities and the citizens
    they serve. The 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act contained landmark
    provisions for the development and build out of the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband
    Network (NPSBN) and established The Public Safety Trust Fund (PSTF) to support
    the design and implementation of the Network. The Act charged the NIST with utilizing
    up to $300 million of PSTF allocations to establish an R&D program to support
    the development and deployment of NPSBN from fiscal year 2016 through 2022. In
    response to the Act s mandate, NIST PSCR developed the Public Safety Innovation
    Accelerator Program to augment internal research by providing funds to support
    a range of research mechanisms that span from external grants and cooperative
    research agreements to prize challenge competitions. The aim of these research
    mechanisms is to accelerate communications innovation in support of public safety
    communities and the citizens they serve. NIST PSCR contracted Eastern Research
    Group, Inc. (ERG) of Lexington, MA to conduct an economic impact analysis (EIA)
    of PSTF investments into NIST PSCR s research mechanisms. ERG conducted an EIA
    using standard economic input-output multipliers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis
    (BEA) to show how NIST PSCR s research investments translate into broader impacts
    to states, focusing on new jobs, earnings, value added, and total economic output.
    The results of the EIA (presented in 2020 dollars) show that NIST PSCR s investment
    of $230 million into the suite of research mechanisms generated 4,280 jobs, $262
    million in earnings, $431 million in value added, and $513 million in total economic
    output.
