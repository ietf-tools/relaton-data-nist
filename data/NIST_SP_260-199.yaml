abstract:
- content: This Standard Reference Material (SRM) is intended primarily for use in
    the preparation of calibration solutions for a candidate reference measurement
    procedure for human serum albumin (HSA) in human urine. This candidate reference
    measurement procedure is being developed by NIST to be used in the certification
    of a matrix-based reference material to support the clinical measurement of HSA
    in human urine. In addition to its use to support the reference measurement system
    for the clinical measurement of HSA in human urine, SRM 2925 Human Serum Albumin
    Solution can be used as a reference standard for assays of total protein by colorimetric
    methods. SRM 2925 may also be used for other procedures, such as gel diffusion,
    amino acid analysis, electrophoresis, proteomics experimental workflows, or other
    tests that require a well-characterized protein for calibration or evaluation.
    The recombinant HSA protein content of this SRM was determined using amino acid
    analysis. A unit of SRM 2925 consists of 3 vials, each containing approximately
    0.5 mL of solution. This publication documents the analytical methods and statistical
    evaluations involved in realizing this product.
