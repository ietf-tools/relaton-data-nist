abstract:
- content: When a weights and measures administrator makes decisions within a specific
    jurisdiction, it is beneficial to understand the scope of the entire system and
    to reflect upon methods and practices that have been tested over the years. This
    handbook was developed for the weights and measures administrator to be used as
    a reference tool. It is designed to read in sections as needed for a specific
    situation or to learn piece by piece about the weights and measures system as
    a whole. The reader is invited to submit comments on any section within this document
    and to provide updates and corrections as they are identified.
