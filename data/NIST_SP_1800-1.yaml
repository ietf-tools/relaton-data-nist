abstract:
- content: Health care providers increasingly use mobile devices to receive, store,
    process, and transmit patient clinical information. According to our own risk
    analysis, discussed here, and in the experience of many health care providers,
    mobile devices can present vulnerabilities in a health care organization's networks.
    At the 2012 Health and Human Services Mobile Devices Roundtable, participants
    stressed that mobile devices are being used by many providers for health care
    delivery before they have implemented safeguards for privacy and security. This
    NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular, open, end-to-end reference
    design that can be tailored and implemented by health care organizations of varying
    sizes and information technology sophistication. Specifically, the guide shows
    how health care providers, using open source and commercially available tools
    and technologies that are consistent with cybersecurity standards, can more securely
    share patient information among caregivers using mobile devices. The scenario
    considered is that of a hypothetical primary care physician using her mobile device
    to perform reoccurring activities such as sending a referral (e.g., clinicalinformation)
    to another physician, or sending an electronic prescription to a pharmacy. While
    the design was demonstrated with a certain suite of products, the guide does not
    endorse these products in particular. Instead, it presents the characteristics
    and capabilities that an organization's security experts can use to identify similar
    standards-based products that can be integrated quickly and cost-effectively with
    a health care provider's existing tools and infrastructure.
