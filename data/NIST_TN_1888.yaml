abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a
    prototype field test standard (FTS) that incorporates three test methods that
    could be used by state weights and measures inspectors to periodically test the
    accuracy of fuel delivery at retail hydrogen gas vehicle refueling dispensers,
    much as gasoline dispensers are tested today. The three field test methods are:
    1) gravimetric, 2) Pressure, Volume, Temperature (PVT), and 3) master meter. The
    FTS was tested in NIST s Transient Flow Facility with helium gas and in the field
    at a hydrogen dispenser location. This document describes the design and construction
    of the test standard, necessary safety instrumentation for working with high pressure
    hydrogen gas, how to execute tests with the FTS, and the operating specifications
    of the FTS components. This document is intended to aid others attempting to design
    and construct similar apparatuses.'
