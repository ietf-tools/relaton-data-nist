abstract:
- content: The Corona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound effect
    on the entire world. With the onset of the pandemic in 2020, also started various
    efforts around the world to automate the contact tracing process to increase its
    efficacy. Most of these efforts and the smartphone apps that were developed used
    the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to detect
    proximity between people. This was facilitated by the development of the Google-Apple
    Exposure Notification (GAEN) system that made it possible for Android phones and
    iPhones to exchange standardized BLE messages seamlessly so that RSSI could be
    measured by both types of phones. In the summer of 2020, we carried out a five-week
    long BLE RSSI data collection campaign using wearable devices developed at NIST
    and running on a Raspberry Pi platform. The data collection was comprehensive,
    because it included a wide variety of operational scenarios including situations
    where the two devices were not in line-of-site of each other. To the best of our
    knowledge, there are no publicly reported repositories of BLE RSSI data that includes
    non-line-of-site (NLOS) scenarios. Such scenarios are important, because they
    can lead to false alarms in detecting situations where virus transmission between
    two people is possible. The paper presents a classical analytical framework for
    proximity detection in the context of electronic contact tracing for COVID-19.
    We make a distinction between instantaneous and after the fact proximity detection.
    In the former case, the purpose is to instantaneously warn people that they are
    violating social distancing rules. In the latter case, the purpose is to notify
    people after the fact that they had a close contact of certain duration with an
    individual who has tested positive for COVID-19 and was capable of transmitting
    the virus at the time of the contact. We evaluate the performance of various methods
    for instantaneous proximity detection. In after the fact proximity detection,
    we are interested in identifying periods of time where two people were too close
    to each other with no barriers between them. We propose a method that applies
    the Viterbi Algorithm to a time series of BLE RSSI data to solve this problem.
    The method exploits the fact that humans do not move faster than certain speed.
    In both cases of instantaneous and after the fact proximity detection, we show
    that methods based on BLE RSSI data leave a lot of room for improvement. Therefore,
    the problem of proximity detection for electronic contact tracing and blunting
    the spread of highly infectious diseases is far from solved. We also know that
    the next pandemic is not a matter of if but when.
