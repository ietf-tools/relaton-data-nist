abstract:
- content: Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides mechanisms to protect data during
    electronic dissemination across the Internet. This Special Publication provides
    guidance to the selection and configuration of TLS protocol implementations while
    making effective use of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and NIST-recommended
    cryptographic algorithms. It requires that TLS 1.2 configured with FIPS-based
    cipher suites be supported by all government TLS servers and clients and requires
    support for TLS 1.3 by January 1, 2024. This Special Publication also provides
    guidance on certificates and TLS extensions that impact security.
