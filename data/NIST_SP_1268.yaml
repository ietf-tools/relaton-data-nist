abstract:
- content: 'NIST held a three-day workshop, Challenges for Digital Proximity Detection
    in Pandemics: Privacy, Accuracy, and Impact Jan. 26th 28th, 2021. Members of industry,
    academia, nonprofits, state, and federal government were brought together to discuss
    successes and challenges associated with implementation of proximity detection
    technologies and to identify areas in which additional effort is required. The
    first day featured invited speakers on a variety of aspects of proximity detection
    and the existing challenges. The second day featured a panel discussion and facilitated
    break-out sessions to provide opportunity for community engagement on ways to
    overcome the challenges presented in the first day. The final day included reports
    from the break-out sessions, contributed technical talks, and a wrap-up discussion.
    This document provides an overview of the presentations and discussions and describes
    key themes that emerged during the workshop. The agenda, video of the invited
    talks on Jan. 26th and of the panel discussion on Jan. 27th, and slides from the
    contributed talks are available on the website, https://www.nist.gov/newsevents/events/2021/01/challenges-digital-proximity-detection-pandemics-privacy-accuracyand.'
