abstract:
- content: The goal of this exploratory project is to demonstrate the feasibility
    of a conductometric measurement to determine the time-resolved soot deposition
    on surfaces in fire environments. Quantitative soot deposition data enabled by
    this measurement method is lacking in the literature and would be useful to advance
    fire analysis and fire model development. Laminar flow through a thin rectangular
    channel with a transverse temperature gradient is used to generate thermophoretic
    deposition exposures on a target surface. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling
    is used to design the channel geometry to have well characterized laminar velocity
    and temperature profiles. The results predict that fully developed laminar flow
    and temperature profiles are established by the midpoint of the channel length.
    The linear temperature gradient between channel walls causes thermophoretic deposition
    of soot particles on the cold wall of the channel. The channel flow is also modeled
    with NIST's Fire Dynamics Simulator to generate predictions of soot deposition
    in the channel. In the experiments particles depositing on the target surface
    cause an increase in the conductance between the interdigitated electrodes. The
    change in conductance is measured intermittently before, during and after the
    exposure using a pico-ammeter and an applied voltage. At the end of the exposure
    the mass loading of deposited soot is determined by two separate measurement methods,
    including a gravimetric method and a light transmission method. The relationship
    between the amount of deposition and the conductometric response is evaluated
    for both types of mass loading measurements. The gravimetric method produced a
    more coherent correlation to gauge conductance with less scatter than the transmission
    method. The measured mass loadings are also combined with measurements of the
    incoming soot concentration to calculate the overall deposition velocity.
