abstract:
- content: This Recommendation defines a mode of operation, called Counter with Cipher
    Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CCM), for a symmetric key block cipher
    algorithm. CCM may be used to provide assurance of the confidentiality and the
    authenticity of computer data by combining the techniques of the Counter (CTR)
    mode and the Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) algorithm.
