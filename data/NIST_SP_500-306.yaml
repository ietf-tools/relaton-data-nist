abstract:
- content: The document describes the procedure by which fingerprint image downsampling
    procedures will be evaluated with respect to conformance to the NIST guidance
    for sample rate reduction of 1000 ppi friction ridge images to 500 ppi as specified
    in NIST Special Publication 500-289. This guidance is to be followed whenever
    1000 ppi images are to be prepared for comparison to legacy 500 ppi fingerprint
    databases for submittal to the FBI's Next Generation identification system and
    conformance will ensure that CODECs produce encoded files that retain fidelity
    to the non-compressed source images within empirically set limits and that such
    files can be decoded by other conformant JPEG 2000 CODECs maintaining the required
    fidelity. The document describes the attributes of a set of fingerprint images
    selected for certification testing and the rationale for selection of these images
    based on spatial frequency fidelity of downsampled images to non-compressed images
    scanned at 500 ppi where downsampling is performed using the Gaussian filter with
    subsampling method specified in NIST SP 500-289. The document describes the procedure
    to be followed in have an algorithm tested for certification, the metric used
    to measure conformance, and provides instructions on how to run the protocol and
    submit results to NIST for evaluation.
