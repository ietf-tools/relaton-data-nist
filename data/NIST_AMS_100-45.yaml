abstract:
- content: Mobile manipulators, which consist of a robotic manipulator arm on a vehicular
    base, enable more flexible and dynamic workflows in manufacturing processes by
    freeing the manipulator arm from the restriction of working on a single, calibrated
    workspace. A mobile manipulator-on-cart further enhances job concurrency since
    the manipulator arm is mounted to a detachable cart rather than directly to the
    vehicle payload structure. With this increase in flexibility, there is a need
    to understand new sources of position and orientation uncertainty. This uncertainty
    can degrade the accuracy and precision of the mobile manipulator position and
    orientation in addition to the coordination capability between the manipulator
    and vehicle. To facilitate performance evaluation and uncertainty characterization,
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed an artifact-based
    measurement methodology for mobile manipulator-on-a-cart systems. The artifact,
    which is re-configurable, simulates mock-assembly tasks for manufacturing applications
    and is compared to a ground truth consisting of an optical tracking system. In
    this paper, we document experimental procedures, data analysis methods, and results
    in measuring the performance of the manipulator-on-a-cart system. We also compare
    the speed and accuracy of two example coordinate registration techniques to be
    used by the mobile manipulator-on-a-cart to reduce position and orientation uncertainty.
