abstract:
- content: This Recommendation specifies the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), an algorithm
    for authenticated encryption with associated data, and its specialization, GMAC,
    for generating a message authentication code (MAC) on data that is not encrypted.
    GCM and GMAC are modes of operation for an underlying approved symmetric key block
    cipher.
