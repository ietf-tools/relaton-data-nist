abstract:
- content: 'This report documents our evaluation of three digital PCR (dPCR) based
    methods for estimating the proportion, if any, of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
    in a sample that is believed to be mostly double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). These methods
    are: 1) a modification of a published real time chamber-digital PCR (cdPCR) method,
    2) comparing droplet-digital (ddPCR) results for native samples with those of
    an aliquot that has been gently heat-denatured, and 3) comparing ddPCR results
    for native samples with those of an aliquot in which dsDNA entities have been
    enzymatically rendered non amplifiable. The cdPCR method requires use of exceptionally
    efficient PCR assays and appears to be insensitive to ssDNA proportions less than
    about 8%. The denaturation/native comparison does not provide a unique estimate
    of ssDNA proportion but rather an upper limit. The enzymatic method requires careful
    choice and evaluation of restriction enzyme and PCR assay but has the potential
    to provide metrologically traceable estimates of the proportion of ssDNA.'
