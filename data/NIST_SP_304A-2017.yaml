abstract:
- content: 'This publication is a colorful chart explaining the 7 base units of the
    SI (International System of Units) and prefix symbols, featuring the Measurement
    League: Guardians of the SI. The Measurement League are superheroes dedicated
    to the fight against uncertainty, imprecision, and inaccuracy and to improving
    the quality of our lives and the things we build. The League of SI Superheroes
    was designed to encourage students to learn about metric measurements as they
    consider science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. SI
    familiarity and fluency must be developed along the STEM career pipeline to prepare
    the future workers with essential measurement skills.'
