abstract:
- content: The Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12 called for new standards
    to be adopted governing the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow
    physical and logical access to Federal government locations and systems. The Personal
    Identity Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors, Federal Information
    Processing Standard (FIPS 201) was developed to establish standards for identity
    credentials. This document, Special Publication 800-76 (SP 800-76), is a companion
    document to FIPS 201. It specifies technical acquisition and formatting requirements
    for the biometric credentials of the PIV system, including the PIV Card1 itself.
    It enumerates required procedures and formats for fingerprints and facial images
    by restricting values and practices included generically in published biometric
    standards. The primary design objective behind these particular specifications
    is universal interoperability. For the preparation of biometric data suitable
    for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) background check, SP 800-76 references
    FBI documentation, including the ANSI/NIST Fingerprint Standard and the Electronic
    Fingerprint Transaction Sets.
