abstract:
- content: Advanced mobile manipulators offer the manufacturing industry the potential
    of a highly adaptive system to perform precision assembly tasks in agile environments.
    Developing performance measurement capabilities for mobile manipulator systems
    will support the advancement of manipulator-vehicle coordination, precision, accuracy,
    and robustness. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed
    a measurement methodology for advanced mobile manipulators, which are mobile robots
    with an onboard robot arm, each from a different manufacturer and with a different
    controller. The measurement methodology is designed to assess the performance
    of mobile manipulators for manufacturing applications such as assembly, where
    position and orientation accuracy are critically important. The proposed methodology
    used an artifact designed at NIST to simulate an assembly task station. An optical
    tracking system measured the location of the targets, the mobile base position
    and orientation, and the position of a manipulator end-of-arm tool. The experimental
    data collected, using three different system computers, were timestamped using
    local clocks synchronized via the NIST internal and local area networks to align
    the data streams. The mobile manipulator system, the experimental methodology,
    the data analysis, and the results of the measurement methodology uncertainty
    and mobile manipulator positioning uncertainty using the novel artifacts are described
    in this paper. For the system tested, the mobile manipulator detection of 2 mm
    diameter fiducials can be achieved after registration. With validation from the
    optical tracking system, the study demonstrated that the Reconfigurable Mobile
    Manipulator Artifact (RMMA) has potential for serving as a novel standalone, low-cost
    test method for measuring the positioning uncertainty of mobile manipulators within
    a measurement uncertainty of 2 mm.
