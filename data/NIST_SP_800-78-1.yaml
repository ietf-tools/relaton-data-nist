abstract:
- content: 'SP 800-78-1 has been modified to enhance interoperability, simplify the
    development of relying party applications, and enhance alignment with the National
    Security Agency''s Suite B Cryptography [SUITE B]. Revision 1 reduces the set
    of elliptic curves approved for use with PIV cards and the supporting infrastructure
    from six curves to two. Also, SHA-384 has been added for use with Curve P-384
    in this revision. And finally, this revision eliminates the largest size of RSA
    keys (3072 bits) on PIV cards. These changes simplify applications that require
    maximum interoperability: the number of OIDs that must be recognized (e.g., in
    certificates) has been significantly reduced; and elliptic curve implementations
    of elliptic curve cryptography can be optimized for operations over two specific
    curves.'
