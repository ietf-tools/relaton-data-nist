abstract:
- content: This report documents NIST's execution of the Intelligence Advanced Research
    Projects Activity (IARPA) Face Recognition Prize Challenge 2017. The (FRPC) was
    conducted to assess the capability of contemporary face recognition algorithms
    to recognize faces in photographs collected without tight quality constraints
    e.g. non-ideal images collected from individuals who are unaware of, and not cooperating
    with, the collection. Such images are characterized by variations in head orientation,
    facial expression, illumination, and also occlusion and reduced resolution.
