abstract:
- content: This report summarizes the results of work performed for the Naval Air
    Warfare Center Aircraft Division by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST), Applied Chemicals and Materials Division on the properties of polyol ester
    lubricants under interagency agreement number N0042115IP00008. The works includes
    purity analysis and assessment, decomposition studies, experimental measurements
    on density, isobaric heat capacity, speed of sound, vapor pressure, viscosity,
    thermal conductivity, and distillation curve measurement. Models were developed
    for the thermodynamic properties, viscosity, and thermal conductivity that represent
    these properties to nearly within their experimental uncertainty for three pure
    polyol ester base fluids (pentaerythritol tetrapentanoate (POE5), pentaerythritol
    tetraheptanoate (POE7), pentaerythritol tetranonanoate (POE9), and a fully qualified
    lubricant meeting military specification MIL-PRF-23699.
