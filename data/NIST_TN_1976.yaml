abstract:
- content: Building stakeholders need practical metrics, data, and tools to support
    decisions related to sustainable building designs, technologies, standards, and
    codes. The Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has addressed this high priority national need by extending its metrics
    and tools for sustainable building products, known as Building for Environmental
    and Economic Sustainability (BEES), to whole-buildings through its Building Industry
    Reporting and Design for Sustainability (BIRDS) framework. The BIRDS framework
    is a sustainability measurement system consisting of whole-building sustainability
    metrics that are based on innovative extensions to life-cycle assessment (LCA)
    and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches involving whole-building energy simulations.
    The measurement system evaluates the sustainability of both the materials and
    the energy used by a building over time. It assesses the 'carbon footprint' of
    buildings as well as 11 other environmental performance metrics, and integrates
    economic performance metrics to yield science based measures of the business case
    for investment choices in high-performance green buildings. The BIRDS framework
    has been leveraged to assist building architects and designers to evaluate the
    sustainability performance of custom building designs through the development
    of BIRDS NEST (Neutral Environment Software Tool), an application programming
    interface (API) that allows other software tools to submit building characteristics
    and performance information (in a standardized format) to develop sustainability
    performance metrics for a customized building design. The beta version of BIRDS
    NEST is focused on performing a life-cycle environmental impact assessment (LCIA)
    based on 12 impact categories for single-family residential buildings. The BIRDS
    NEST has been designed to interact with NREL's OpenStudio (OS), an open-source,
    cross-platform collection of software tools that supports whole building energy
    modeling using EnergyPlus. In collaboration with NREL's OS Team, an OS Measure
    has been developed to successfully send and receive information to and from BIRDS
    NEST, allowing OS users to develop LCIA estimates for OS building models without
    leaving the OS application. This technical manual describes BIRDS and its LCA
    and LCIA methodology and data, development of BIRDS NEST and the associated OS
    Measure, and BIRDS NEST's limitations, planned release, and the development of
    its future capabilities.
