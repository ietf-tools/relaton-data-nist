abstract:
- content: This report documents the steps followed to calibrate an all-wheel steer
    Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) for optimal performance. Proper calibration of
    the steering and drive parameters of an AGV are critical for accurate dead-reckoning
    navigation, and improves the performance of an AGV servoing based on navigational
    information. Calibration of the navigation system alignment is also important
    for proper control of the AGV. This report discusses the calibration of the distance
    encoder, the steering offsets, and the sensor mounting angle on the AGV. Manual
    methods for performing the AGV calibration are discussed that require a minimum
    of specialized equipment.
