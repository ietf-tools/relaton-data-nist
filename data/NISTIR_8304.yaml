abstract:
- content: 'Static analyzers examine the source or executable code of programs to
    find problems. Many static analyzers use heuristics or approximations to examine
    programs with millions of lines of code for hundreds of classes of problems. The
    Ockham Sound Analysis Criteria recognizes static analyzers that are precise. In
    brief the criteria are (1) the analyzer''s findings are claimed to always be correct,
    (2) it produces findings for most of a program, and (3) even one incorrect finding
    disqualifies an analyzer. This document begins by explaining the background and
    requirements of the Ockham Criteria and how we determine if a tool satisfies it.
    As part of Static Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE) VI, we examined two tools: Astree
    and Frama-C with the Evolved Value Analysis (Eva) plug-in. Examining the tool
    outputs led us to find several systematic mistakes in the Juliet 1.3 test suite
    and thousands of mistakes in its manifest of known errors. Our conclusion is that
    Astree and Frama-C with Eva satisfied the SATE VI Ockham Sound Analysis Criteria.'
