abstract:
- content: 'Turbulent flow around an axisymmetric hill at Reynolds number Re H ? 1.3
    10 5 with respect to the hill height is studied using resolved large-eddy simulations
    (LES). The purpose of the paper is to examine the effect of turbulence in the
    inflow boundary condition on the flow around the hill. To this end LES simulations
    were performed for the following inflow boundary conditions: (i) mean turbulent
    boundary-layer profile obtained experimentally, and (ii) unsteady turbulent velocity
    profiles from a precursor LES, with the mean profile of the precursor LES forced
    to agree with experimental results, all other flow parameters in the two simulations
    being identical. Comparisons with reliable experiments available in the literature
    showed that the flow, in particular the complex separation dynamics in the lee-side
    of the hill, is sensitive to the inflow boundary condition. It was found that
    the mean flow and turbulence statistics in the turbulent-inflow simulation are
    in good agreement with the experimental results both upstream and downstream of
    the hill. However, the steady-inlet simulation yields a thicker and longer separation
    region than was observed experimentally. Consequent recovery of the flow downstream
    is also delayed where an inner vortex rotating in the same direction accompanies
    an outer vortex in either side of the midspan plane; the inner vortex pair is
    not obtained in either the experiment or the turbulent-inflow simulation. Despite
    these significant discrepancies, the upstream-side flow and the separation location
    for both simulations are in reasonably good agreement with the experiment. This
    can be attributed to the fact that the pressure gradient set by the geometry dictates
    the separation initiation through the formation of an internal layer. Incoming
    turbulence in a simulation suppresses the separated shear layer by increasing
    the near-wall velocity gradient, thereby causing early reattachment as in the
    experiment.'
