abstract:
- content: 'Current codes and standards for seismic design are based on a life-safety
    approach, meaning that the focus is on saving lives when an earthquake occurs.
    The most recent reauthorization of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program
    (NEHRP), P.L. 115-307 recognizes that to strengthen America’s resilience to earthquakes,
    it is necessary to advance beyond a life-safety approach towards also preserving
    the functionality of buildings and lifeline infrastructure systems. This would
    enable community members to return to their homes and businesses, and resume community
    activities, more quickly after an earthquake occurs. One new target under development
    for extending performance beyond life safety is referred to as “functional recovery.”
    A committee of subject matter experts organized by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified
    options and recommendations for moving the Nation towards functional recovery
    in a report titled “FEMA P-2090/NIST SP-1254: Recommended options for improving
    the built environment for post-earthquake reoccupancy and functional recovery
    time”, or the “NISTFEMA Report.” Recommendation 1 from the NIST-FEMA Report provides
    an overarching recommendation to “Develop a Framework for Post-Earthquake Reoccupancy
    and Functional Recovery Objectives.” Recommendation 4 from the NIST-FEMA Report
    addresses lifeline infrastructure systems, with the recommendation being to “Design,
    Upgrade, and Maintain Lifeline Infrastructure Systems to Meet Recovery-Based Objectives.”
    Lifeline infrastructure systems include transportation systems such as roads,
    highways, bridges, rail, and ports. This document summarizes a NIST-organized
    workshop held in September 2022 on transportation systems and functional recovery.
    The event enabled discussion, knowledge transfer, and interaction with subject
    matter experts from both research and practitioner backgrounds on mechanisms for
    improving functional recovery and resilience of transportation systems for earthquake
    events. Invited speakers were selected to provide representation from diverse
    groups and presentations were shared on both research and practical projects or
    programs, including from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Informed by
    past projects and interactions with FHWA, the topical areas for presentations
    were designed to provide workshop attendees with an overview of cutting-edge research,
    practice, and ongoing federal programs to broaden perspectives and stimulate cross-disciplinary
    insights throughout the day. The workshop also included breakout sessions, report-outs,
    and discussion among workshop attendees on key questions to identify the current
    status, challenges, priorities, and future vision for transportation systems and
    functional recovery. This effort is a continuation of earlier efforts in developing
    the NIST-FEMA Report to explore options for functional recovery and is not intended
    to set any functional recovery goals or recovery times for transportation systems.
    It is intended provide insights on functional recovery and transportation systems
    and inform development of a functional recovery framework. This report details
    the discussion and important themes that emerged from the workshop. The insights
    gained from the workshop will help to identify research needs and paths forward
    to continue working toward Recommendation 1 and Recommendation 4 of the NIST-FEMA
    Report.'
