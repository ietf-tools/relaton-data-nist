abstract:
- content: 'Premise plumbing systems need to meet a range of performance goals including
    occupant health and comfort, energy and water efficiency, and reduced environmental
    impacts. Pressures to improve water efficiency and building water quality, combined
    with the use of new plumbing technologies and designs, have led to the recognition
    that significant knowledge gaps exist in plumbing system design, installation,
    operation, and maintenance. The research needed to address these gaps was summarized
    in a 2020 NIST report Measurement Science Research Needs for Premise Plumbing
    Systems. NIST also initiated an effort in 2020 to study several key research topics
    identified in that report including: the pressure versus flow relationships of
    plumbing fittings, the factors contributing to pathogen growth in residential
    hot water systems, the development of standard plumbing systems for comparing
    different design and operational approaches, and the improvement of existing premise
    plumbing system simulation software. To obtain feedback from industry and others
    in the premise plumbing community, NIST held a one-day workshop in November 2022
    to discuss these research efforts, strengthen ongoing dialogues among the plumbing
    community, and develop a shared understanding of the research needs.'
