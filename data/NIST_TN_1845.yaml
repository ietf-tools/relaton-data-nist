abstract:
- content: This Technical Note develops a method for identifying residential fire
    incidents, reported to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), with
    missing information regarding the item first ignited (IFI) or item most contributing
    to flame spread (IMCFS) that were likely to have involved upholstered furniture.
    Using NFIRS data, upholstered furniture involvement can only be identified using
    the IFI or IMCFS fields; however, it is not uncommon for these fields to contain
    missing values or to be coded as unknown (undetermined). Current statistical methods
    address this issue by allocating the missing and unknown incidents proportionally
    over the distribution of those known. The appropriateness of this depends on the
    representativeness of the known incidents. This Technical Note explores a data
    imputation method to determine the likelihood of upholstered furniture involvement
    based on statistical correlations with other factors describing the fire incident.
    A number of competing statistical models are evaluated using the data imputation
    approach, with the best performing models selected based on the minimum out-of-sample
    root mean squared prediction error. The optimum models based on this criterion
    are then used to estimate the number of U.S. residential upholstered furniture
    fires, related occupant fatalities, injuries, and property and content losses,
    and the results are compared to the conventional scaling-based techniques currently
    used by the National Fire Protection Association
