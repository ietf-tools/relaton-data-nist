abstract:
- content: This Special Publication represents the work of researchers at professional
    conferences, as reported by NIST employees in Fiscal Year 2021 (October 1, 2020
    September 30, 2021). NIST is committed to the idea that results of federally funded
    research are a valuable national resource and a strategic asset. To the extent
    feasible and consistent with law, agency mission, resource constraints, and U.S.
    national, homeland, and economic security, NIST will promote the deposit of scientific
    data arising from unclassified research and programs, funded wholly or in part
    by NIST, except for Standard Reference Data, free of charge in publicly accessible
    databases. Subject to the same conditions and constraints listed above, NIST also
    intends to make freely available to the public, in publicly accessible repositories,
    all peer-reviewed scholarly publications arising from unclassified research and
    programs funded wholly or in part by NIST. More information on public access to
    NIST research is available at https://www.nist.gov/open.
