abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Technical Investigation
    of the 2011 Joplin, MO tornado identified that no widely accepted standards exist
    for emergency communications in tornado events and more specifically, policies
    involving the use of communication systems to alert the public in advance of tornadoes.
    This publication provides evidence-based guidance for communities on the creation
    and provision of public alerts, including both alerts provided by outdoor siren
    (warning) systems and short messages sent by social media or other short message
    service (SMS) platforms. It is the hope that this guidance can eventually be used
    as input for standardization, through codes and standards, of the procedures and
    practices for outdoor siren systems and short message alerts used by communities
    across the United States. Standardization of emergency communication policies
    and procedures could occur at multiple levels, including among multiple jurisdictions,
    state-wide, regionally, or even nationally. This document begins with a brief
    background on alerting systems, focusing specifically on outdoor siren systems
    and short message alerts. The next section presents the methods used for the development
    of evidence-based guidance on public alerts, including methods for review of literature
    on public response to public alerting systems, the development of preliminary
    guidance based on these reviews, and the finalization of the guidance presented
    here in this report. Then, guidance for communities on the creation and provision
    of public alerts for those under imminent threat is presented. This document ends
    with a discussion on unanswered questions, providing opportunities for further
    research into various areas of public alerting.
