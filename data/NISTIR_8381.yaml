abstract:
- content: 'One-to-many biometric search systems are discussed in their role of positive
    and negative identification - the former refers to the expectation that person
    in a probe sample is present in the database (as in access to an office) while
    the latter presumes the person is not (as in compulsive gamblers entering a casino).
    The distinction is useful because the application differ in their tolerance for
    false negatives and false positives. This report addresses the positive use of
    one-to-many facial recognition in airport transit settings in which travelers''
    faces are matched against galleries of individuals expected to be present. We
    primarily consider the case where face recognition serves double-duty for access
    control (to an aircraft) and facilitation (of recording a visa-holder''s exit).
    This report summarizes three NIST activities: First, to describe the biometric
    aspects of the immigration exit application and factors that are expected to affect
    its performance; second, to document results from running offline simulations
    in which recent accurate face recognition algorithms are applied to actual ENTRY
    and EXIT images with the goals of establishing a methodology, estimating accuracy,
    and exposing some factors that will affect those estimates; third to consider
    whether the use of face recognition at other airport touchpoints airport where
    higher populations are expected.'
