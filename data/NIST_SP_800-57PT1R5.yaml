abstract:
- content: This Recommendation provides cryptographic key-management guidance. It
    consists of three parts. Part 1 provides general guidance and best practices for
    the management of cryptographic keying material, including definitions of the
    security services that may be provided when using cryptography and the algorithms
    and key types that may be employed, specifications of the protection that each
    type of key and other cryptographic information requires and methods for providing
    this protection, discussions about the functions involved in key management, and
    discussions about a variety of key-management issues to be addressed when using
    cryptography. Part 2 provides guidance on policy and security planning requirements
    for U.S. government agencies. Part 3 provides guidance when using the cryptographic
    features of current systems.
