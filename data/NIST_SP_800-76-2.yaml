abstract:
- content: Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12, Policy for a Common Identification
    Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors [HSPD-12], called for new standards
    to be adopted governing interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical
    and logical access to Federal government locations and systems. The Personal Identity
    Verification (PIV) standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Federal Information
    Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees
    and Contractors (FIPS 201), was developed to define procedures and specifications
    for issuance and use of an interoperable identity credential. This document, Special
    Publication 800-76 (SP 800-76), is a companion document to FIPS 201. It describes
    technical acquisition and formatting specifications for the PIV system, including
    the PIV Card itself. It also establishes minimum accuracy specifications for deployed
    biometric authentication processes. The approach is to enumerate procedures and
    formats for collection and preparation of fingerprint, iris and facial data, and
    to restrict values and practices included generically in published biometric standards.
    The primary design objective behind these particular specifications is to enable
    high performance and universal interoperability. The introduction of iris and
    face specifications into the current edition adds alternative modalities for biometric
    authentication and extends coverage to persons for whom fingerprinting is problematic.
    The addition of on-card comparison offers an alternative to PIN-mediated card
    activation as well as an additional authentication method.
