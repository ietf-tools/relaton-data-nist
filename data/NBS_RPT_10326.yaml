abstract:
- content: This report presents in detail the results and critical analyses of several
    recently completed NBS experimental investigations, literature surveys, and developments
    of new measurement methods. The heat of formation of C¿̐¿F was measured by burning
    it with H2 in a flame calorimeter; the result is shown to favor the new lower
    dissociation energy of F2 32.0 kcal per mol, but not unambiguously owing to uncertain
    interpretations of necessary auxiliary data. A transpiration search for chemical
    reaction between HF and gaseous A¿̐¿F3 revealed none detectable, near 1200 K and
    up to 0.75 atm of HF, beyond the sensitivity of the method (1-2Z). Selected values
    of the standard heats, free energies, and entropies of formation of a number of
    niobium compounds resulting from an up-to-date critical review of the literature
    are discussed and tabulated. The heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and hemispherical
    total and normal spectral emittances of tantalum metal were measured by an accurate
    high-speed pulse technique from 1900 to 3200 K; the spectral emittance (at a wavelength
    of 650 nm) was found to decrease approximately 3.5% during the initial one-third
    of the melting period. The pulse heating technique is adapted to measuring the
    melting points of thin-wire electrical conductors above 2000 K, and checked by
    finding 2044 K (estimated uncertainty, + 5 K) for platinum (accepted value, 2045
    K). In designing a transpiration technique for seeking unknown higher gaseous
    hydrates of beryllia above 2000 K, the results of detailed calculations are presented
    which show that sufficiently accurate temperature measurement, dubious by pyrometer,
    can probably be met by comparison with the volatility of gold and application
    of several corrections. The results of several investigations of barium and one
    of its compounds are presented. Accurate heat-capacity and enthalpy measurements
    on the metal from 18 to 1173 K show several anomalies, unusually high heat capacities,
    and a heat of fusion which is thought to reflect solubility of BaO impurity in
    the liquid metal. Based on these new thermal data, a third-law analysis was made
    of the existing vapor-pressure data, leading to a heat of sublimation of the metal
    whose uncertainty is believed to be due largely to uncertainties in the published
    vapor pressures. Atomic barium, deposited in solid-argon matrices containing isotopic
    varieties of 0^, yielded infrared values for two stretching frequencies of several
    isotopic forms of the BaO2 molecule; the (much weaker) 0-0 stretching frequency
    is interpreted as evidence that the molecule is essentially Ba02.
