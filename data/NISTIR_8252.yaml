abstract:
- content: Iris Exchange (IREX) IX is an evaluation of automated iris recognition
    algorithms. The first part of the evaluation was a performance test of both verification
    (one-to-one) and identification (one-to-many) recognition algorithms over operational
    test data. Those results are summarized in NIST IR 8207. The second part of the
    evaluation constitutes a multispectral evaluation of iris recognition. Those results
    are summarized in this report. All currently deployed iris recognition systems
    operate on images of the iris illuminated in the near infrared band of the electromagnetic
    spectrum. The ISO/IEC 19794-6 and 29794-6 standards require the eye to be illuminated
    between 'approximately 700 and 900 nanometers (nm)'. Near infrared light is specified
    because melanin, the pigment that makes dark eyes dark, is nearly transparent
    in the near infrared. This evaluation assesses the accuracy of state-of-the-art
    iris matchers over a much wider range of the spectrum. Particular attention is
    placed on the visible (400 nm to 700 nm) and short wave infrared (700 nm to 1550
    nm) bands. Principle testing was performed over the Consolidated Multispectral
    Iris Dataset (CMID) which was provided to NIST by the Southern Methodist University.
    Collected in well controlled laboratory settings, the dataset is ideal for multispectral
    analysis. It contains about a quarter-million iris samples from over 200 subjects,
    by far the largest of its kind as of this writing. Thirteen research institutions
    submitted matching algorithms for testing.
