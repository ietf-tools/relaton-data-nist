abstract:
- content: This NIST Internal Report contains a metadata schema for attributes that
    may be asserted about an individual during an online transaction. The schema can
    be used by relying parties to enrich access control policies, as well as during
    run-time evaluation of an individual's ability to access protected resources.
    Attribute metadata could also create the possibility for data sharing permissions
    and limitations on individual data elements. There are other possible applications
    of attribute metadata, such as evaluation and execution of business logic in decision
    support systems or associated with devices or non-person entities; however, the
    metadata contained herein is focused on supporting an organization's risk-informed
    authorization policies and evaluation for individuals.
