abstract:
- content: Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models explicitly address software
    security in detail, so secure software development practices usually need to be
    added to each SDLC model to ensure that the software being developed is well-secured.
    This document recommends the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) a core
    set of high-level secure software development practices that can be integrated
    into each SDLC implementation. Following such practices should help software producers
    reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released software, mitigate the potential
    impact of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and address
    the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent future recurrences. Because the
    framework provides a common vocabulary for secure software development, software
    acquirers can also use it to foster communications with suppliers in acquisition
    processes and other management activities.
