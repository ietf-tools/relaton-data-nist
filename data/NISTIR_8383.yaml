abstract:
- content: The one-classifier and two-classifier significance testing for evaluation
    and comparison of classifiers are conducted to investigate the statistical significance
    of differences and provide quantitative information in terms of the significance
    level, i.e., p-value, in a new ROC analysis where three score distributions and
    two decision thresholds are employed, and data dependency caused by multiple use
    of the same subjects is involved. To analyze the performance of classifiers, the
    standard error of the cost function is estimated using the nonparametric three-sample
    two-layer bootstrap algorithm on a two-layer data structure constructed after
    dataset optimization, based on our prior rigorous statistical research in ROC
    analysis on large datasets with data dependency. In comparison, the positive correlation
    coefficient must be taken into consideration, which is computed using a synchronized
    resampling algorithm; otherwise, the likelihood of detecting the statistical significance
    of difference between the performance levels of two classifiers can be wrongly
    reduced.
