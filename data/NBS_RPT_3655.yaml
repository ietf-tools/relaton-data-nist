abstract:
- content: Computations, based on a proposed method of computing the influence coefficients
    of a delta wing, were made to determine the influence coefficients of a swept-back
    model wing for which experimental results were available. Comparison of computed
    results with experimental data showed poor agreement. The lack of agreement is
    in part attributed to insufficient knowledge regarding the shear stiffness of
    ribs and bulkheads.
