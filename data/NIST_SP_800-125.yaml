abstract:
- content: The purpose of SP 800-125 is to discuss the security concerns associated
    with full virtualization technologies for server and desktop virtualization, and
    to provide recommendations for addressing these concerns. Full virtualization
    technologies run one or more operating systems and their applications on top of
    virtual hardware. Full virtualization is used for operational efficiency, such
    as in cloud computing, and for allowing users to run applications for multiple
    operating systems on a single computer.
