abstract:
- content: There are a variety of new, improved, and/or innovative fire protection
    technologies that have the potential to improve fire protection and life safety
    in residences including barrier fabrics for upholstered furniture, new nano-scaled
    flame retardants, and better fire detection technology. However, there is no accepted
    methodology available to determine the absolute or even relative performance of
    different technologies. The Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute for
    Standards and Technology (NIST) has undertaken an effort to develop a method to
    better quantify the relative improvements in fire safety provided by different
    technologies to evaluate the impact of changes in prescriptive or performance-based
    requirements. In order to better understand the overall process for the analysis,
    this report examines the process for quantitative calculation of fire hazard of
    fire protection design alternatives using as an example case study the potential
    benefits of alternate requirements for residential smoke alarms. The case study
    will help define the process, data, and tools necessary for a quantitative analysis
    of changes in fire protection designs. The long-term goal of the project is to
    develop a well-defined process and set of tools for such analyses. This report
    shows the result of the case study as well as a discussion of the procedure itself.
    Several conclusions are apparent. With the speed of current machines and zone
    fire models, it is practical to generate tens of thousands of cases to analyze.
    There is also a need for additional data, including but not limited to fire data,
    information about the distribution of floor plans and about type and arrangement
    of the contents. Finally, there needs to be guidance and modeling available to
    account for the impact of occupants actions and their interactions with fires.
    Going forward, research should focus on a two-prong approach. First, tools are
    needed to make Monte Carlo analysis more efficient. Second, additional opportunities
    to apply Monte Carlo analysis to real research problems would develop a base of
    expertise to further the use of this analysis.
