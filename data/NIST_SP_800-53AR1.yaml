abstract:
- content: Special Publication 800-53A, Revision 1 provides guidelines for developing
    security assessment plans and associated security control assessment procedures
    that are consistent with Special Publication 800-53, Revision 3, Recommended Security
    Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, August 2009 (including
    updates as of 05-01-2010). NIST has been working in partnership with the Office
    of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DOD),
    and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) to develop a common information
    security framework for the federal government and its contractors. The updated
    security assessment guideline incorporates best practices in information security
    from the United States Department of Defense, Intelligence Community, and Civil
    agencies and includes security control assessment procedures for both national
    security and non national security systems. The guideline for developing security
    assessment plans is intended to support a wide variety of assessment activities
    in all phases of the system development life cycle including development, implementation,
    and operation. The important changes described in Special Publication 800-53A,
    Revision 1, are part of a larger strategic initiative to focus on enterprise-wide,
    near real-time risk management; that is, managing risks from information systems
    in dynamic environments of operation that can adversely affect organizational
    operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The increased
    flexibility in the selection of assessment methods, assessment objects, and depth
    and coverage attribute values empowers organizations to place the appropriate
    emphasis on the assessment process at every stage in the system development life
    cycle.
