abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), at the request
    of the National Institute of Healths (NIHs) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS)
    and in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
    initiated a third interlaboratory analytical comparison study of fatty acid concentrations
    in human serum in 2016. Three unknown serum samples were distributed along with
    Standard Reference Material (SRM) 1950 Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma as the
    control sample. This is a performance-based program so participating laboratories
    were requested to use the analytical procedures that they typically use in their
    laboratories for these analyses and report data for those fatty acids that they
    typically quantify. The results from the third exercise are reported along with
    a summary of the analytical methods used by each laboratory.
