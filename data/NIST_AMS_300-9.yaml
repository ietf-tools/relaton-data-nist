abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Office
    of Naval Research (ONR) have partnered to investigate the application of digital
    manufacturing methods and technologies within the navy shipyard. As a part of
    the effort, wireless network deployments are considered. This report provides
    an overview of the wireless networking requirements of navy shipyards specifically
    for the transmission of machine information outside and inside of the vessel during
    construction. Recommended approaches are included with each use case. This report
    is intended to provide the reader with direction to other larger resources and
    documentation provided by NIST.
