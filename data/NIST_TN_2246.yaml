abstract:
- content: This manuscript presents the Generator Fleet Characteristics Model (GFCM),
    a general purpose tool for the analysis of power system operations, economics,
    and resilience. The GFCM is a collection of MATLAB functions that use publicly
    available data with national coverage to produce year-long (8760 hour) analyses
    of the electric grid at the balancing authority level. As the name implies, the
    GFCM builds up a series of snapshots of electric grid conditions and outcomes
    using the economics of the generator feet as a starting point for understanding
    system complexity and dynamics. While the synchronous inertia application we present
    here uses the GFCM to build a detailed picture of the present state of electric
    grid operations and market outcomes, the model is designed to facilitate counterfactual
    study through the comparison of model outputs by an analyst that systematically
    varies inputs. The GFCM forms a modeling framework intended to aide in the formulation
    of what if questions regarding how the grid might operate under changing ambient
    conditions while harnessing evolving technologies.
