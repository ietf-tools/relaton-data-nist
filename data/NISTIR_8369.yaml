abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in the process
    of selecting one or more authenticated encryption and hashing schemes suitable
    for constrained environments through a public, competition-like process. In February
    2019, 57 candidates were submitted to NIST for consideration. Among these, 56
    were accepted as first-round candidates in April 2019, and after four months,
    NIST selected 32 of these as second-round candidates. In March 2021, NIST announced
    10 finalists to move forward to the final round of the standardization process.
    This report describes the evaluation criteria and selection process based on public
    feedback and internal review of the second-round candidates. The following candidates
    are selected as finalists: ASCON, Elephant, GIFT-COFB, Grain128-AEAD, ISAP, Photon-Beetle,
    Romulus, Sparkle, TinyJambu, and Xoodyak.'
