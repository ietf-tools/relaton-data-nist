abstract:
- content: This report captures feedback from two workshops that NIST conducted to
    determine the challenges and opportunities in the use and design of Smart Grid
    Testbeds and Collaborations, which were held April 11, 2019, at the University
    of Tennessee, Knoxville, and April 23, 2019, at the University of Vermont. Both
    workshops were sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
