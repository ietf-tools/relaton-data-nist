abstract:
- content: The push for open data has made a multitude of datasets available enabling
    researchers to analyze publicly available information using various statistical
    and machine learning methods in support of policy development. An area of increasing
    interest that is being made available is public safety data, which can include
    both sensitive information and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Release
    of sensitive data and PII can lead to individual and organizational harm. However,
    the removal of PII alone is an insufficient approach to preventing linkage attacks
    -- the process of combining unrelated data to identify individuals and entities.
    A growing body of academic research in the field of differential privacy exists
    which claims strict mathematical guarantees of data privacy, but with a potentially
    greater loss of dataset utility. In 2017 National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division initiated efforts
    to test, evaluate and strengthen research in differential privacy and add to its
    growing body of knowledge by making available open source algorithms for public
    safety use. This publication describes the design and results of PSCR's multi-phased
    innovation prize challenge and makes recommendations for conducting future challenges
    in differential privacy.
