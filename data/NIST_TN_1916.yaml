abstract:
- content: A wide variability exists among commercial radiation detection instruments
    used to measure exposure rate or ambient dose equivalent rate. These instruments
    are used to measure both the radiation background and the radiation field produced
    by radioactive sources that are used to test other types of radiation detection
    systems against different consensus document standards. Most radiation fields
    specified in the ANSI standard are quite low, ranging from 0.05 Sv/h to 0.5 Sv/h
    above background. Due to the radiation fields being so low in intensity, the uncertainty
    of the measurements made with these instruments can be potentially quite large.
    As a result of these large uncertainties, it is possible that the response of
    the various parameters being tested by the standards (e.g., alarm indication,
    radionuclide identification) will be dependent on the specific radiation detector
    employed by the testing laboratory. In this work, we used two different methods
    to set the radiation fields to analyze the differences that can be expected. One
    method is based on measurements performed with a high pressure ion chamber while
    the second method is based on calculating the radiation fields from a known source
    activity using a point source estimate. The sources of uncertainties in both methods
    are identified and are reflected in the differences that can be expected in setting
    the radiation fields. In order to achieve consistency across different testing
    laboratories in setting radiation fields, we provide insight to what are the most
    relevant factors that affect the determination of the field using either one of
    the two methods.
