abstract:
- content: 'This report summarizes the results from the 2017 NIST/OAGi Workshop: Enabling
    Composable Service-Oriented Manufacturing Systems, which was held at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology campus in Gaithersburg, MD, on April 10-11,
    2017. This was the third in a new series of workshops begun in 2015 to foster
    a shared vision of a new Smart Manufacturing (SM) platform to support Composable
    Service-Oriented Manufacturing (SOM) systems. The purpose of the workshop series
    is to identify and discuss challenges in advancing the vision of open cloud service
    platforms for Smart Manufacturing systems. As in the previous workshop reports,
    the document describes (1) the vision of Composable Service-Oriented Manufacturing
    systems as a basis for achieving easily assembled and re-configurable Smart Manufacturing
    systems, (2) the five breakout sessions, each addressing the vision from a unique
    perspective, and (3) the key findings from the workshop as well as the next steps
    planned for the workshop series. The breakout session descriptions provide an
    overview of respective research and development areas, their goals, capability
    gaps, proposed technology characteristics, and priority working items.'
