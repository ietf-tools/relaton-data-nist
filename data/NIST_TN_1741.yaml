abstract:
- content: This paper describes how modeling and simulation can play a major role
    in developing standards recommendations for patient compartment layout of automotive
    ambulances in the United States to improve performance and safety. Acquiring necessary
    information from relevant stakeholders is shown as a method that can be used to
    determine user design requirements. The requirements will in turn be used to develop
    design concepts taking into consideration human interface with the ambulance work
    environment. The modeling and simulation of clinical care activities in the ambulance
    can be used to evaluate the design concepts and determine those that would better
    meet safety and performance requirements.
