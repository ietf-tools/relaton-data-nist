abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to assist Federal agencies in protecting
    the confidentiality of personally identifiable information (PII) in information
    systems. The document explains the importance of protecting the confidentiality
    of PII in the context of information security and explains its relationship to
    privacy using the the Fair Information Practices, which are the principles underlying
    most privacy laws and privacy best practices. PII should be protected from inappropriate
    access, use, and disclosure. This document provides practical, context-based guidance
    for identifying PII and determining what level of protection is appropriate for
    each instance of PII. The document also suggests safeguards that may offer appropriate
    levels of protection for PII and provides recommendations for developing response
    plans for incidents involving PII. Organizations are encouraged to tailor the
    recommendations to meet their specific requirements.
