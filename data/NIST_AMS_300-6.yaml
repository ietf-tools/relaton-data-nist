abstract:
- content: Manufacturing is moving to a digital paradigm where data is produced and
    consumed faster than ever. Managing this quantity of data is critical to daily
    operations and requires access to trustworthy data. Data management is an rapidly-evolving
    field that is adapting to support new requirements and the exponentially increasing
    quantity of data. The technologies and strategies to manage data are diverse--from
    a centralized database and single source of truth, to distributed systems and
    cloud storage/computing--and each with their own strengths and flaws. While a
    single-source-of-truth can easily be corrupted or tampered with, distributed systems
    often face synchronization issues. Organizations that deal with large amounts
    of data must identify these strengths and flaws accurately to find the best solutions.
    In this paper, we discuss blockchain, the foundation of the bitcoin electronic
    currency, as a data management technology. Blockchain is a distributed storage
    framework that is virtually tamper resistant, has a native synchronization-discrepancy-resistance
    mechanism and is already highly praised in the financial world. We explore opportunities
    in the manufacturing area where digital product data is becoming a critical asset
    and present our initial assessment and early recommendations on how to record
    product data transactions on a blockchain.
