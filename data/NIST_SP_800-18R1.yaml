abstract:
- content: The objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information
    system resources. All federal systems have some level of sensitivity and require
    protection as part of good management practice. The protection of a system must
    be documented in a system security plan. The completion of system security plans
    is a requirement of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
    Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, Security of Federal
    Automated Information Resources, and Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled
    the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), The purpose of the system
    security plan is to provide an overview of the security requirements of the system
    and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.
    The system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior
    of all individuals who access the system. The system security plan should be viewed
    as documentation of the structured process of planning adequate, cost-effective
    security protection for a system. It should reflect input from various managers
    with responsibilities concerning the system, including information owners, the
    system owner, and the senior agency information security officer (SAISO). Additional
    information may be included in the basic plan and the structure and format organized
    according to agency needs, so long as the major sections described in this document
    are adequately covered and readily identifiable.
