abstract:
- content: 'This report summarizes a review of the scientific foundations of bitemark
    analysis conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
    Bitemark analysis typically involves examining patterned injuries left on a victim
    or object at a crime scene, identifying those injuries as bitemarks, and comparing
    those marks with dental impressions from a person of interest. This review specifically
    focuses on pattern injuries found on human skin. Over 400 sources were considered
    via literature searches and input from previous efforts by the National Institute
    of Justice Forensic Technology Center of Excellence. Our NIST review also utilized
    input from an October 2019 Bitemark Thinkshop organized by the Center for Statistics
    and Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE) where experts and stakeholders associated
    with bitemark analysis were convened to discuss key issues. Based on this input,
    our study found a lack of support for three key premises of the field: 1) human
    dentition is unique at the individual level, 2) this uniqueness can be accurately
    transferred to human skin, and 3) identifying characteristics can be accurately
    captured and interpreted by analysis techniques. Furthermore, our review noted
    a lack of consensus among practitioners on the interpretation of bitemark evidence
    as well as thoughts on how to move the field forward. If the field seeks to advance,
    the key takeaways provided in this review are starting points for areas needing
    improvement, not an exhaustive list of specific shortcomings.'
