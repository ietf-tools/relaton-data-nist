abstract:
- content: Several international standards and regulations regarding residential cooktop
    ignition prevention have existed for as long as a decade. A series of cooking
    experiments were conducted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    to examine the effectiveness of the cooktop ignition prevention technologies.
    Several types of commercially available full-scale residential cooktops with integrated
    ignition prevention technologies were tested. The experiments provided data on
    the character of the ignition prevention technologies and their performance in
    terms of ignition prevention of oil-based cooking fires. About 80 experiments
    were conducted using both gas and electric cooktops, including four propane gas
    powered cooktops sold in Asia and one stove with electric coil heating elements
    sold in the USA. One retrofit ignition prevention system for electric coil heating
    elements was also tested. The ignition prevention technologies used a variety
    of configurations and engineering designs. Experiments were conducted using four
    types of cooking vessels. The pans tested were approximately round, about 20 cm
    to 22 cm in diameter, and 4 cm to 5 cm in depth. The tests followed the UL 858
    standard on abnormal cooktop fire hazards. Five thermocouples were attached on
    the bottom of the pans in a cross pattern and the average pan temperature during
    cooking was monitored. For the experiments involving cooking oil, the incidence
    of auto-ignition was observed. About half of the experiments were conducted using
    dry pans and about half were conducted on pans that held small amounts of Canola
    oil. The results showed that some of the cooktop technologies were more reliable
    than others in preventing oil ignition and maintaining temperatures below the
    UL 858 standard's limit temperature criteria. And the results confirm that residential
    cooktop ignition prevention technologies can be effective for both electric and
    gas cooktops.
