abstract:
- content: The primary objective of the Structure Separation Experiment project is
    to assess structure-to-structure fire spread for structures located in the Wildland
    Urban Interface (WUI). As part of this project, full scale fire experiments will
    be conducted in which various types of structures (sources of fire) will be used
    to generate typical radiative and convective heat exposures on target structures
    (residential dwellings). The spacing between the source and target structures
    will be varied to identify safe structure separation distance (SSD). Most experiments
    will be conducted with construction materials currently listed in State of California
    building codes and using code compliant structural assemblies. A limited number
    of experiments will be conducted with enhanced, ignition resistant, materials
    that may not currently be listed by the State of California. The project is divided
    into three phases. Phase 1 will test sheds as fire sources, Phase 2 will test
    in-law buildings and Phase 3 will test single-family homes. Source terms from
    1.39 m to 24.8 m (15 ft2 to 267 ft2) will be tested in Phase 1. Phase 2 will examine
    exposures from a 40.87 m (440 ft2) in law building and Phase 3 will characterize
    exposures from approximately 92.90 m (1000 ft2) residences. The goal of this report
    is to present a preliminary modeling approach for estimating an upper bound for
    the safe structure separation distance (SSD). This work is part of the larger
    modeling effort for the Structure Separation Experiments project and is intended
    to compliment the vast number of full-scale experiments that are being performed
    as part of this project.
