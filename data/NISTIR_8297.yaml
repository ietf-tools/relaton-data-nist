abstract:
- content: This document summarizes conclusions from a workshop focused on Interoperability
    of Web Computational Plugins for Large Microscopy Image Analyses. The workshop
    conclusions are classified as practical recommendations and agreements on development
    and future research related to (1) containerization of execution code, (2) data
    storage, (3) interoperability requirements of workflow engines for running containerized
    plugins, (4) standard packaging of web user interface modules, and (5) security
    of container-based distribution.
