abstract:
- content: 'Background: Wireless technology has great appeals to many manufacturers,
    in this case industrial automation systems, which include process control, discrete
    manufacturing, safety systems, and building automation. Applying wireless sensing
    and control technologies in new or existing systems for monitoring and controlling
    equipment and processes eliminates costly cabling and enables configuration flexibility.
    In addition, using wireless technologies can improve plant-floor operating conditions,
    performance, and efficiency. But before applying these technologies, companies
    need to determine what wireless technology will be suitable and reliably operate
    to communicate measurement and control data in challenging industrial environments
    with many potential physical obstructions and sources of interference. Purpose:
    To explore latest and future wireless technologies for establishing best practice
    guidelines to help manufacturers and users make confident decisions in selecting
    and applying appropriate wireless technologies for their plants or factories based
    on their operating requirements and environments.'
