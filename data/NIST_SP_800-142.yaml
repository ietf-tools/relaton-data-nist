abstract:
- content: Combinatorial testing can help detect problems like this early in the testing
    life cycle. The key insight underlying t-way combinatorial testing is that not
    every parameter contributes to every fault and most faults are caused by interactions
    between a relatively small number of parameters. This publication provides a self-contained
    tutorial on using combinatorial testing for real-world software, including how
    to use it effectively for system and software assurance. It introduces the key
    concepts and methods, explains use of software tools for generating combinatorial
    tests (freely available on the NIST web site csrc.nist.gov/acts), and discusses
    advanced topics such as the use of formal models of software to determine the
    expected results for each set of test inputs. With each topic, a section on costs
    and practical considerations explains tradeoffs and limitations that may impact
    resources or funding. The material is accessible to an undergraduate student of
    computer science or engineering, and includes an extensive set of references to
    papers that provide more depth on each topic.
