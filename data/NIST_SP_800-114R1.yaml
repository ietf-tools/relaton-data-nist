abstract:
- content: Many people telework, and they use a variety of devices, such as desktop
    and laptop computers, smartphones, and tablets, to read and send email, access
    websites, review and edit documents, and perform many other tasks. Each telework
    device is controlled by the organization, a third party (such as the organization
    s contractors, business partners, and vendors), or the teleworker; the latter
    is known as bring your own device (BYOD). This publication provides recommendations
    for securing BYOD devices used for telework and remote access, as well as those
    directly attached to the enterprise s own networks.
