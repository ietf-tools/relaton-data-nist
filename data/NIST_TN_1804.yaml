abstract:
- content: During structural fire fighting suppression operations, fire fighters wear
    protective gear to insulate them from the high temperature environment including
    hot combustion gases, burning surfaces, and thermal radiation. Current turnout
    gear insulates the fire fighter to such an extent, basically encapsulating his/her
    entire body that it is more difficult for each individual fire fighter to understand
    how hazardous or hot the thermal environment is. A fire fighter s body is usually
    covered with protective gear during search and rescue operations. Therefore, the
    natural heatsensing mechanism of the body is incapable of sensing the ambient
    temperature, possibly putting firefighters at risk. A thermal sensing device that
    attaches to the visor of the head gear is designed to restore situational awareness
    of the firefighter by showing varying heat intensity through different colored
    warning indicators in the firefighter s line of sight. Human factors evaluation
    of the performance of the warnings in the thermal sensing device was conducted
    in laboratory-scale (i.e., climatic chamber experiments) and in full-scale (i.e.
    fire experiments in ISO room) environments. While a previous report discussed
    the laboratory-scale experiments, this report describes the full-scale fire exposure
    experiments. The evaluation involved tracking the performance of multiple thermal
    sensors within a standard room during live fire tests.
