abstract:
- content: The Sensor Handbook is intended as a guide for those who design, specify,
    use, and test military automatic test equipment containing sensors. The handbook
    addresses measurands and principles of measurement, data acquisition, sensor calibration
    and testing, environmental considerations, stability, durability, reliability,
    and error assessment. Sensor manufacturers and sensor calibration and evaluation
    resources are included, as is an annotated bibliography. The handbook is based
    largely on the present, proved state-of-the-art. Possible future trends are briefly
    discussed. The handbook is addressed to the general engineer, system designer,
    or manager with an engineering background. It does not provide the highly detailed
    technical information needed by the measurement engineer, although ample references
    are included for further study.
