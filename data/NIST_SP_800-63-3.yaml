abstract:
- content: This document and its companion documents, SP 800-63, SP 800-63A, and SP
    800-63B, provide technical and procedural guidelines to agencies for the implementation
    of federated identity systems and for assertions used by federations. This publication
    supersedes corresponding sections of SP 800-63-2. These guidelines provide technical
    requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are
    not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this
    purpose. This guideline focuses on the use of federated identity and the use of
    assertions to implement identity federations. Federation allows a given credential
    service provider to provide authentication and (optionally) subscriber attributes
    to a number of separately-administered relying parties. Similarly, relying parties
    may use more than one credential service provider.
