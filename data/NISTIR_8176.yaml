abstract:
- content: In order for security solutions for application container environments
    to effectively meet their security objectives, it is necessary to analyze those
    security solutions and detail the metrics they must satisfy in the form of security
    assurance requirements. Since Linux and its various distributions form the predominant
    host OS component of the deployed container platforms, the focus of this document
    is on security assurance requirements for security solutions for application containers
    hosted on Linux.
