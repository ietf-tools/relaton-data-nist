abstract:
- content: Organizations are concerned about the risks associated with products and
    services that may contain potentially malicious functionality, are counterfeit,
    or are vulnerable due to poor manufacturing and development practices within the
    supply chain. These risks are associated with an enterprise's decreased visibility
    into, and understanding of, how the technology they acquire is developed, integrated,
    and deployed, or the processes, procedures, standards, and practices used to ensure
    the security, resilience, reliability, safety, integrity, and quality of the products
    and services. This publication provides guidance to organizations on identifying,
    assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain at all
    levels of their organizations. The publication integrates cybersecurity supply
    chain risk management (C-SCRM) into risk management activities by applying a multilevel,
    C-SCRM-specific approach, including guidance on development of C-SCRM strategy
    implementation plans, C-SCRM policies, C-SCRM plans, and risk assessments for
    products and services.
