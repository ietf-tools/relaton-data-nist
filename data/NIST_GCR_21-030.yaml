    literature helped informed the study conducted by COACh, a grassroots organization
    based out of the University of Oregon with a mission to increase the number and
    success of women and underrepresented groups in science and engineering. An accompanying
    annotated bibliography, found under Appendix A, provides an overview of the sources
    included in this body of work.'
