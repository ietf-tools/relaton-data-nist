    literature helped informed the study conducted by COACh, a grassroots organization
    based out of the University of Oregon with a mission to increase the number and
    success of women and underrepresented groups in science and engineering. An accompanying
    annotated bibliography, found under Appendix A, provides an overview of the sources
