abstract:
- content: 'This Recommendation specifies four types of SHA-3-derived functions: cSHAKE,
    KMAC, TupleHash, and ParallelHash, each defined for a 128- and 256-bit security
    strength. cSHAKE is a customizable variant of the SHAKE function, as defined in
    Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 202. KMAC (for KECCAK Message Authentication
    Code) is a variable-length message authentication code algorithm based on KECCAK;
    it can also be used as a pseudorandom function. TupleHash is a variable-length
    hash function designed to hash tuples of input strings without trivial collisions.
    ParallelHash is a variable-length hash function that can hash very long messages
    in parallel.'
