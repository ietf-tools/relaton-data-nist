abstract:
- content: Residential solar photovoltaic (PV) system installations have become more
    prevalent as the installed cost has decreased over the last 10 years while system
    performance has improved. As these installations have increased, so too has interest
    in determining their economic value to a homeowner. PV installation cost estimates
    have typically assumed the entire cost as marginal (average cost per watt) using
    reported data aggregated to a state or country. This study implements a cost function
    that includes a fixed cost and marginal cost element to account for differences
    in cost structures while controlling for panel quality and specific location.
    The analysis uses county level installed quote data applied to estimate cost functions
    and apply these functions to life cycle cost analyses of the Washington DC-Maryland-Virginia
    (DMV) metropolitan area while incorporating state and county level differences
    in pricing and incentives. The estimated cost function is found to provide an
    installed cost estimate that is statistically different than using the traditional
    total average cost per watt approach for both standard and premium systems up
    to 9 kW and 11 kWh, respectively. The analysis finds no statistical difference
    in the installed cost function across counties, but clear differences in the life-cycle
    cost-effectiveness to a homeowner due to state policies and retail electricity
    prices. Absent financing, only PV systems in DC are life-cycle cost effective
    compared to retail electricity due to DC s strong solar renewable energy credit
    (SREC) market. PV can be cost effective in Maryland if financing and incentives
    are applied while no combination of financing or incentives makes PV cost effective
    in Virginia due to its lower relative electricity prices. Sensitivity analysis
    finds that the homeowner s assumed discount rate and the upcoming phase out of
    the federal investment tax credit (ITC) has a significant impact on residential
    PV economics.
