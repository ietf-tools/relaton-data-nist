abstract:
- content: In this report, we introduce a framework to analyze, monitor, and identify
    the state of industrial wireless networks and their impact on industrial use cases.
    This framework is based on a deep learning approach for modeling the interactions
    between the wireless network and industrial use cases. The framework uses the
    information from different system layers including the spectrum measurements,
    physical layer metrics, network layer packets, and application layer production-related
    metrics in order to study the industrial wireless network behavior. The output
    of the framework can be generally used to improve system management and optimization
    functions.
