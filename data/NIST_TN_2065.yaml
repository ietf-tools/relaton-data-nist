abstract:
- content: 'The room temperature elastic-plastic fracture toughness of additively
    manufactured (AM) Ti-6Al-4V was characterized by means of Elastic Compliance (EC)
    tests on Charpy-type fatigue precracked and side-grooved specimens. Various fabrication
    and material conditions were investigated: as-built parameters (effects of scan
    length and use of supports) and hot isostatic pressing parameters (effects of
    temperature and cooling rate). The results, although strictly not fully compliant
    with ASTM E1820-18ae1, can be considered representative of the fracture toughness
    of the material in the different conditions, and compare favorably with literature
    data for both non-AM and AM Ti-6Al-4V. Additional analyses were conducted with
    another single-specimen approach (Normalization Data Reduction) and were compared
    with EC results.'
