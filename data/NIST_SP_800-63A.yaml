abstract:
- content: These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing
    digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or
    use of standards outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the enrollment
    and verification of an identity for use in digital authentication. Central to
    this is a process known as identity proofing in which an applicant provides evidence
    to a credential service provider (CSP) reliably identifying themselves, thereby
    allowing the CSP to assert that identification at a useful identity assurance
    level. This document defines technical requirements for each of three identity
    assurance levels. This publication supersedes corresponding sections of NIST Special
    Publication (SP) 800-63-2.
