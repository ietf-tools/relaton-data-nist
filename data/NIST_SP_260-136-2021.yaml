abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), formerly the
    National Bureau of Standards, was established by the U.S. Congress in 1901 and
    charged with establishing a measurement foundation to facilitate U.S. and international
    commerce. NIST provides reference materials and reference instruments that are
    used to ensure the accuracy, metrological traceability, and comparability of measurement
    results in many diverse fields of science, industry, and technology. This document
    provides and explains the vocabulary used at NIST to describe the reference materials
    and reference instruments available to NIST s customers. This document also describes
    the methods used in developing NIST reference materials. The definitions and descriptions
    provided supersede those used in the original versions of this publication, NIST
    SP260-136 and SP260-136-2020.
