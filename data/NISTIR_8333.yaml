abstract:
- content: This report provides a summary of the discussion and findings from the
    NIST Cybersecurity Risks in Consumer Home IoT Devices virtual workshop in October
    2020. NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8259, Foundational Cybersecurity Activities
    for IoT Device Manufacturers, and NISTIR 8259A, IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability
    Core Baseline, provide general guidance on how manufacturers can approach their
    role of fulfilling their customers' cybersecurity needs and capabilities. As discussed
    in those documents, particular sectors and use cases may require more specific
    guidance than what is included in NISTIR 8259A's core baseline for Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices. To better understand the consumer home device sector, NIST
    collected observations on the cybersecurity device capabilities in a number of
    devices available in the first half of 2019. These observations were published
    in Draft NISTIR 8267, Security Review of Consumer Home Internet of Things (IoT)
    Products. The information in Draft NISTIR 8267 was foundational for the NIST Cybersecurity
    Risks in Consumer Home IoT Devices virtual workshop. The workshop gathered further
    community input on the concerns with consumer home IoT device cybersecurity.
