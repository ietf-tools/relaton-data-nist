abstract:
- content: A wireless sensor network was created to measure water-flow rate in a fire
    hose. An integrated electronic piezoelectric (IEPE) accelerometer was chosen as
    the sensor to measure the flow rate based on the vibrations generated by water
    flowing through a fire hose close to the hose nozzle. These sensors are small,
    lightweight, and they can attach to the outside of the hose, not obstructing the
    water¿̐¿s flow path. A relationship between the dominant frequency metric and
    the flow rate was applied and used to determine real-time water flow in a fire
    hose critical for improving fireground situational awareness. A nearly monotonic
    relationship of flow rate to the dominant frequency was established and then used
    in a custom graphical user interface for quick, real-time, visual referencing
    by fire personnel of flow rate in a fire hose. While more work is needed, such
    as improved physical robustness of the sensor-node assembly and increase robustness
    of the signal metric, this preliminary study showed the potential of a ¿̐¿smart¿̐¿
    fire hose for improved situational awareness during a fire attack.
