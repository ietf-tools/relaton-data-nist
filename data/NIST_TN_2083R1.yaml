abstract:
- content: A series of measurements was conducted to characterize the structure of
    a 1 m diameter methanol pool fire steadily burning with a constant lip height
    in a well-ventilated quiescent environment. Time-averaged local measurements of
    gas-phase temperature were conducted using 50 ?m diameter, Type S, bare wire,
    thermocouples with a bead that was approximately spherical with a diameter of
    about 150 ?m. The thermocouple bead temperature was corrected for radiative loss
    and thermal inertia effects. The contribution of the radiative loss correction
    and thermal inertia correction terms to uncertainty of the gas velocity was analyzed.
    A simulation of the 1 m methanol pool fire was conducted using the Fire Dynamics
    Simulator (FDS) to obtain the gas velocity distribution above the burner which
    helped correct the thermocouple temperature measurement to obtain the gas temperature.
    The gas temperature distribution profile above the burner centerline was compared
    to previous studies of a 30 cm methanol fire. The maximum mean gas temperature
    was 1371 K, which occurred 30 cm above the burner on the centerline. Careful analysis
    determined that the average combined uncertainty of the mean and the standard
    deviation of the measured gas temperature was 5 % and 26 %, respectively. The
    actual heat release rate was measured using oxygen consumption calorimetry and
    compared favorably with the ideal heat release rate calculated from the measured
    mass burning rate. The heat flux distribution about the pool fire was measured
    using fourteen wide-angle view, water-cooled, Gardon-type, total heat flux gauges.
    The radiative emission from the fire was estimated by considering the radiative
    heat flux through a virtual cylinder about the fire and by a single point estimate.
    The radiative emission measurements coupled with the mass loss measurement allowed
    determination of the radiative fraction, which was equal to 0.22 16 % and 0.20
    34 % for the multi-location and single-location measurements, respectively. Flame
    characteristics, such as, the mean flame height, pulsation frequency and the flame
    instability near the fuel surface, were analyzed using the 30 Hz video record
    of the fire. The mean flame height was measured as 1.10 m 0.22 m above the burner
    rim and the puffing frequency was about 1.37 Hz, which was consistent with a Fourier
    analysis of the transient thermocouple measurements (=1.39 Hz 0.013 Hz). The pool
    surface temperature was measured to be nearly the fuel boiling point.
