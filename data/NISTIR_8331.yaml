abstract:
- content: This is the second of a series of reports on the performance of face recognition
    algorithms on faces occluded by protective face masks commonly worn to reduce
    inhalation and exhalation of viruses. This is a continuous study is being run
    under the Ongoing Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) executed by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In our first report, we tested "pre-pandemic"
    algorithms that were already submitted to FRVT 1:1 prior to mid-March 2020. This
    report augments its predecessor with results for more recent algorithms provided
    to NIST after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. While we do not have information
    on whether or not a particular algorithm was designed with face coverings in mind,
    the results show evidence that a number of developers have adapted their algorithms
    to support face recognition on subjects potentially wearing face masks. The algorithms
    tested were one- to-one algorithms submitted to the FRVT 1:1 Verification track.
    Future editions of this document will also report accuracy of one-to- many algorithms.
