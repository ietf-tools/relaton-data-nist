abstract:
- content: 'Organizational security awareness programs may experience a number of
    challenges, including lack of resources, difficulty measuring the impact of the
    program, and perceptions among the workforce that training is a boring, check-the-box
    activity. While prior surveys and research have examined programs in the private
    sector, there is little understanding of whether these findings also apply within
    the U.S. government. To address this gap and better understand the needs, challenges,
    practices, and necessary competencies of federal security awareness teams and
    programs, NIST conducted a comprehensive, two-phase research study that leveraged
    both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. This companion document to NISTIR
    XXXX Federal Cybersecurity Awareness Programs: A Mixed Methods Research Study
    reports on a subset of study results focused on identifying the current approaches
    and challenges of security awareness programs within the federal government. Insights
    gained from these results are informing guidance and other initiatives to aid
    federal organizations in building effective security awareness programs. While
    focused on the U.S. government, findings may also have implications for organizational
    security awareness programs in other sectors.'
