abstract:
- content: The complex flow conditions inherent in power plant smokestacks make accurate
    flow measurements challenging, which in turn limits the accuracy of hazardous
    emissions measurements. While stack composition measurements are assessed daily
    via comparison to a certified gas standard, the flue gas meter is only calibrated
    once a year via the flow relative accuracy test audit (RATA). In most cases the
    flow RATA is performed using an S-type pitot probe whose performance can be adversely
    affected by the complex flow conditions (i.e., asymmetric velocity profile and
    swirling flow) typical in stacks. NIST sponsored a workshop to discuss the current
    and future flow measurement needs with stakeholders in the electric power generation
    industry. The meeting included regulators, owners of stationary sources, stack
    testers, equipment manufacturers, national metrology institutes from other countries,
    flow measurement laboratories, and accreditation bodies. During the workshop participants
    gave presentations on several topics including accreditation, modifications to
    EPA regulations that will improve flow measurement uncertainty, flow RATA accuracy
    for the S-type pitot probe as well as for the prism probe and spherical probe,
    and the accuracy of different continuous emissions measurement systems (CEMS)
    in stack applications. NIST gave tours and presented results from its research
    facilities specifically designed to improve the accuracy of stack flow measurements.
    At several points the workshop participants divided into small groups to discuss
    presentations made by NIST and other participants. Group discussions centered
    around three topics including 1) Air Emission Testing Bodies, 2) Accuracy of RATA
    and CEMS Flow Measurement Methods, and 3) how NIST research facilities can be
    best used to help improve flow measurements in industrial applications.
