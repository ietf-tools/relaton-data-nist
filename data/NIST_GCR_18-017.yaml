abstract:
- content: This report is a supplement to the paper published as Transient Thermal
    Response of an Extended Temperature Range 500-mm diameter Guarded Hot-plate Apparatus
    by Thomas and Zarr (2018), hereafter referred to as the paper. The paper emphasizes
    the use of a mathematical model based on interconnected aggregated-capacity subcomponents
    to determine controller settings for power supplied to various embedded heating
    elements. This report contains additional detailed information on aspects of the
    model that is specific to using LabVIEW software for simulation computations adapted
    to this guarded hot-plate apparatus. The report refers to equations and figures
    by their numbers as listed in the paper. Equations specific to this report are
    labeled with letters to distinguish from references to items in the paper. The
    purpose of the report is to assist users in correcting, modifying, or extending
    the mathematical model by providing additional details to facilitate reading the
    software. Specifically, the report includes heat transfer relationships used,
    component properties such as mass, and methods for evaluating thermal conductances
    along with typical values.
