abstract:
- content: This paper discusses some aspects of selecting and testing random and pseudorandom
    number generators. The outputs of such generators may be used in many cryptographic
    applications, such as the generation of key material. Generators suitable for
    use in cryptographic applications may need to meet stronger requirements than
    for other applications. In particular, their outputs must be unpredictable in
    the absence of knowledge of the inputs. Some criteria for characterizing and selecting
    appropriate generators are discussed in this document. The subject of statistical
    testing and its relation to cryptanalysis is also discussed, and some recommended
    statistical tests are provided. These tests may be useful as a first step in determining
    whether or not a generator is suitable for a particular cryptographic application.
    However, no set of statistical tests can absolutely certify a generator as appropriate
    for usage in a particular application, i.e., statistical testing cannot serve
    as a substitute for cryptanalysis. The design and cryptanalysis of generators
    is outside the scope of this paper.
