abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the ASME
    Standards Subcommittee Meeting on Advanced Monitoring, Diagnostics, and Prognostics
    for Manufacturing Operations on May 22-23, 2019, at the NIST Gaithersburg (Maryland)
    campus. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss progress and future needs, and
    to prioritize work activities for standards and guidelines related to advanced
    monitoring, diagnostic, and prognostic technologies (also identified as Prognostics
    and Health Management (PHM)) for enhancing manufacturing maintenance and control
    strategies. This report documents the results of the meeting, including priority
    topics for standards and guidelines. The next steps in this effort are presented
    towards the end of this document, including planning for future standards events,
    subcommittee meetings, and white paper publication of one of the priority topics.
