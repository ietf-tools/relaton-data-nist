abstract:
- content: Melt-pool-monitoring, layer-wise-imaging, microstructure-analysis, and
    mechanical-property test data are becoming increasingly available during the additive
    manufacturing (AM) fabrication process. These data along with data analytics tools
    are becoming more important because they are needed to plan and control AM processes,
    validate part quality, and accelerate the qualification process. A major impediment
    to using those datasets, however, is that they sets are highly correlated. Even
    though they are obtained from different sensors, instruments, and testing machines
    that live in their own local, coordinate systems. Additionally, these correlated
    datasets must also be aligned with other build data such as process parameters
    and scan paths. This paper presents an innovative, data-registration procedure,
    which is the first step towards addressing the correlation problem. This procedure
    results in a common, reference, coordinate system that provides an effective way
    to use those datasets as inputs to downstream applications such as simulation,
    machine learning, and data analytics.
