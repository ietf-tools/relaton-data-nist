abstract:
- content: This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for
    information systems and organizations to protect organizational operations and
    assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of
    threats and risks, including hostile attacks, human errors, natural disasters,
    structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. The controls
    are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide
    process to manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from
    mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
    standards, and guidelines. Finally, the consolidated control catalog addresses
    security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions
    and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective (i.e.,
    the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the
    controls). Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information
    technology products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently
    trustworthy.
