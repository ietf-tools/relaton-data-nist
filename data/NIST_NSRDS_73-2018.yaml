abstract:
- content: As alternatives to refrigerants with a high global warming potential, blends
    of two or more refrigerants are being utilized as working fluids in heat-pump,
    air-conditioning, and refrigeration systems. Generally, these blends form zeotropes,
    which show temperature and composition changes during evaporation, condensation,
    or flashing process whether it be intended (i.e., through an expansion device)
    or unintended (e.g., a leak from a container or system). REFLEAK simulates leak
    and recharge processes for refrigerant zeotropic blends. This Windows- based simulation
    model provides an easy-to-use package that allows estimation of composition changes
    of zeotropic blends in leak and recharge processes for either vapor or liquid
    leaks under isothermal or adiabatic conditions.
