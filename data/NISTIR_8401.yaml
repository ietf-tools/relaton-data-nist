abstract:
- content: Space operations are increasingly important to the national and economic
    security of the United States. Commercial space's contribution to the critical
    infrastructure is growing in both volume and diversity of services as illustrated
    by the increased use of commercial communications satellite (COMSAT) bandwidth,
    purchase of commercial imagery, and the hosting of government payloads on commercial
    satellites. The U.S. government recognizes and supports space resilience as illustrated
    by numerous space policies, executive orders, and the National Cyber Strategy.
    The space cyber-ecosystem is an inherently risky, high-cost, and often inaccessible
    environment consisting of distinct yet interdependent segments. This report applies
    the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to the ground segment of space operations with
    an emphasis on the command and control of satellite buses and payloads.
