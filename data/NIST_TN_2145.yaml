abstract:
- content: On January 30-31, 2020, a workshop was held at NIST in Gaithersburg, MD
    to review recent developments in measurement capabilities and technologies addressing
    urban GHG emissions, to assess the state of the art and remaining scientific challenges,
    and to identify ways to serve the needs of the specific stakeholders, including
    large municipalities where mitigation actions are planned or underway. Plenary
    lectures provided an overview of current research activities and capabilities.
    Panel discussions were held on scientific and technical successes, and knowledge
    gaps, on researchers' experiences with domestic and international stakeholders,
    and on ways to map technical capabilities to stakeholder needs. During the discussions
    over the two-day workshop, there were several themes that workshop participants
    emphasized about the scientific accomplishments of the community and the remaining
    technical challenges. Synopses of the presentations are given and summarized.
    An executive summary gives an overview of the conclusions of the workshop. Appendices
    include copies of the plenary and supporting presentations made.
