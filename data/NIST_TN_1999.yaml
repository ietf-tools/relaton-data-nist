abstract:
- content: Building stakeholders need practical metrics, data, and tools to support
    decisions related to sustainable building designs, technologies, standards, and
    codes. The Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has addressed this high priority national need by extending its metrics
    and tools for sustainable building products, known as Building for Environmental
    and Economic Sustainability (BEES), to whole buildings. Whole building sustainability
    metrics have been developed based on innovative extensions to life-cycle assessment
    (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches involving whole building energy
    simulations. The measurement system evaluates the sustainability of both the materials
    and the energy used by a building over time. It assesses the carbon footprint
    of buildings as well as 11 other environmental performance metrics, and integrates
    economic performance metrics to yield science-based measures of the business case
    for investment choices in high-performance green buildings. Building Industry
    Reporting and Design for Sustainability (BIRDS) applies the new sustainability
    measurement system to an extensive whole building performance database NIST has
    compiled for this purpose. The updated BIRDS residential building database includes
    energy, environmental, and cost measurements for 9120 new residential buildings,
    covering 10 single-family dwellings (5 one-story and 5 two-story of a various
    of conditioned floor area) in 228 cities across all U.S. states for study period
    lengths ranging from 1 year to 40 years. The sustainability performance of buildings
    designed to meet current state energy codes can be compared to their performance
    when meeting four alternative building energy standard editions to determine the
    impact of energy efficiency on sustainability performance. The impact of the building
    location and the investor's time horizon on sustainability performance (economic
    and environmental) can also be measured.
