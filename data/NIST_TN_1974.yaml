abstract:
- content: The CYCLE_D-HX software package simulates the performance of single-component
    refrigerants and refrigerant blends in subcritical vapor-compression refrigeration
    cycles. The basic system simulated by CYCLE_D-HX consists of a compressor, discharge
    line, condenser, expansion device, evaporator, compressor suction line, and an
    optional liquid-line/suction-line heat exchanger. The other cycles may contain
    a second compressor, one or two economizers, or an intercooler. In contrast to
    simplified vapor compression cycle model, which require refrigerant saturation
    temperatures in the evaporator and condenser as input, CYCLE_D-HX establishes
    saturation temperatures in the heat exchangers using the temperatures profiles
    of heat source and heat sink and the mean effective temperature differences (?Thx)
    in the evaporator and condenser, respectively, which are specified as input to
    the program. This representation of heat exchangers facilitates the inclusion
    of both thermodynamic and transport properties in cycle simulations and makes
    CYCLE_D-HX suitable for comparative evaluations of different refrigerants, particularly
    when applied in systems relying on forced-convection heat transfer of refrigerant
    in the heat exchangers. This software package was developed by the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST), is not subject to copyright protection, and
    is in the public domain.
