abstract:
- content: 'The objective of the NIST database for Simulation of Electron Spectra
    for Surface Analysis (SESSA) is to facilitate quantitative interpretation of Auger-electron
    and X-ray photoelectron spectra (AES/XPS). The database contains physical data
    required to perform quantitative interpretation of an electron spectrum for a
    specimen with a given composition. Retrieval of relevant data is performed by
    a small expert system that queries the comprehensive databases. A simulation module
    is also available within SESSA that provides an estimate of peak intensities as
    well as the energy and angular distribution of the emitted electron flux. The
    information needed by the expert system to accomplish its task closely matches
    instrument settings made by an experimenter when actually performing a measurement
    and is complemented by an initial estimate of the sample composition. SESSA can
    be used for two main applications. First, data are provided for many parameters
    needed in quantitative AES and XPS (differential inverse inelastic mean free paths,
    total inelastic mean free paths, differential elastic-scattering cross sections,
    total elastic-scattering cross sections, transport cross sections, photoionization
    cross sections, photoionization asymmetry parameters, electron-impact ionization
    cross sections, photoelectron lineshapes, Auger-electron lineshapes, fluorescence
    yields, and Auger-electron backscattering factors). Second, Auger-electron and
    photoelectron spectra can be simulated for layered samples and for samples with
    selected nanomorphologies such as islands, spheres, and layered spheres. This
    version of SESSA has the following new features: (1) Two new databases have been
    added to provide additional options for obtaining electron inelastic mean free
    paths and inner-shell ionization cross sections by electron impact; (2) Users
    now have the option of reading a file to describe additional types of sample nano-morphologies.'
