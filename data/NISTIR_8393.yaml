abstract:
- content: In two prior National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Journal
    of Research publications (Parts I and II) [1,2], we presented test procedures
    to detect instrument geometry errors in industrial cone beam X-ray computed tomography
    (XCT) systems. These test procedures were based on simulations performed at one
    position of the measurement volume (one geometrical configuration of the instrument),
    i.e., for fixed locations of the rotation stage (400 mm from the source) and the
    detector (1177 mm from the source). In a subsequent NIST Journal of Research publication
    (Part III) [3], we reported results from simulations performed at various combinations
    of the rotation stage and detector distances from the source. Because of the large
    number of simulations, we abstracted the information and reported key observations
    only. This internal report presents the underlying data generated from the simulations
    performed for the Part III publication and may therefore be considered an addendum
    to that publication.
