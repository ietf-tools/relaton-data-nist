abstract:
- content: This document describes the calibration service to measure proton spin
    relaxation times, T1 and T2, of materials used in phantoms (calibration artifacts)
    to verify the accuracy of MRI-based quantitative measurements. Proton spin relaxation
    times are used as image-based biomarkers to assess the state of tissue and quantify
    the presence of contrast agents. A biomarker, per the FDA definition, refers to
    a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of
    normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or biological responses to
    a therapeutic intervention.(1) Spin relaxation times are phenomenological parameters
    that need to be carefully defined and measured to enable rigorous quantification
    and their use as biomarkers for clinical decision making. The relaxation times,
    in addition to being dependent on local material properties, are dependent on
    global parameters such as temperature and magnetic field value, which need to
    be controlled and precisely measured.
