abstract:
- content: 'Three series of experiments were conducted in this study. First, studies
    were performed to the determine the relative distributions of the target chemicals
    in freshly smoked butts by analyzing six types of samples consisting of different
    parts of the butts, i.e. filter, tobacco and ash. Each sample was analyzed using
    headspace-thermal desorption (TD) gas-chromatograph- mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
    The goal of the headspace analysis was not to fully extract all chemicals remaining
    on the cigarette butt, rather to provide a consistent basis to compare chemical
    emissions into the air from the cigarette butts. Second, the butts were placed
    in a range of controlled conditioning environments for 2 h to 144 h to examine
    the influence of various factors on emissions: temperature, relative humidity,
    ultraviolet (UV) radiation, water saturation and air change rate. Butts were also
    conditioned outdoors in summer and winter seasons to understand butt emissions
    in real environments. After conditioning, each cigarette butt was also analyzed
    using headspace-TD-GC-MS. Lastly, a set of experiments was conducted to measure
    the chemical emission rates from cigarette butts in a walk-in chamber. Air samples
    were collected from the chamber up to 24 h after butts were placed in the walk-in
    chamber and were analyzed using TD-GC-MS.'
