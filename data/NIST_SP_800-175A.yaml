abstract:
- content: This document is part of a series intended to provide guidance to the Federal
    Government for using cryptography and NISTs cryptographic standards to protect
    sensitive, but unclassified digitized information during transmission and while
    in storage. Special Publication (SP) 800- 175A provides guidance on the determination
    of requirements for using cryptography. It includes a summary of laws and regulations
    concerning the protection of the Federal Governments sensitive information, guidance
    regarding the conduct of risk assessments to determine what needs to be protected
    and how best to protect that information, and a discussion of the relevant security-related
    documents (e.g., various policy and practice documents).
