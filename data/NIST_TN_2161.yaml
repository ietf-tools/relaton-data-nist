abstract:
- content: The primary objective of this project is to assess structure-to-structure
    fire spread for structures located in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). Full-scale
    fire experiments will be conducted in which various types of structures (sources
    of fire) will be used to generate typical radiative and convective heat exposures
    on target structures (residential dwellings). The spacing between the source and
    target structures will be varied to identify safe structure separation distance
    (SSD). Most experiments will be conducted with construction materials currently
    listed in State of California building codes and using code compliant structural
    assemblies. A limited number of experiments will be conducted with enhanced, ignition
    resistant, materials that may not currently be listed by the State of California.
    The project is divided into three phases. Phase 1 will test sheds as fire sources,
    Phase 2 will test in-law buildings (small accommodation structures built close
    to primary residential structure) and Phase 3 will test single-family homes. Source
    terms from 1.39 m to 24.8 m (15 ft2 to 267 ft2) will be tested in Phase 1. Phase
    2 will examine exposures from 40.87 m (440 ft2) in-law buildings, and Phase 3
    will characterize exposures from approximately 92.90 m (1000 ft2) residences.
    Dimensions of Phase 3 single residences (source term) will be finalized after
    numerical modeling of the results from Phase 1 and Phase 2. This test plan focuses
    on Phase 1 research. Phase 1 aims to quantify the effects of shed sizes, construction
    types, fuel loading, and separation distance on the ignition of primary structures
    (residential dwellings). Experiments will be conducted at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Insurance Institute for Business and
    Home Safety (IBHS). The NIST experiments will be conducted at the National Fire
    Research Laboratory (NFRL), and the IBHS experiments will be conducted just outside
    of the wind loading test cell. The opening of the test cell (13.7 m (45 ft) wide)
    will dictate the largest source structure that can be evaluated at IBHS.
