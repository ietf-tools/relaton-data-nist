abstract:
- content: NIST launched a CannaQAP in 2020 to improve the comparability of the analytical
    measurements in forensic and Cannabis (hemp and marijuana) testing laboratories.
    CannaQAP is an interlaboratory study mechanism that is similar to a proficiency
    testing scheme; however, the focus is towards education without assigning pass/fail
    grades to anonymized participants. CannaQAP helps inform NIST about the current
    measurement capabilities and challenges to assist in the design and characterization
    of Cannabis RMs. Exercise 1 of CannaQAP focused on the determination of cannabinoids
    including ?9-THC, THCA, total THC, CBD, CBDA, total CBD, and up to 13 additional
    cannabinoids in two hemp oils. This report provides a detailed description of
    the results of this exercise.
