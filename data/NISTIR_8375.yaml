abstract:
- content: 'As we begin to adopt approaches to help the U.S. National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) become a more inclusive organization, we need
    a way to assess the current level of inclusivity. The extent to which individuals
    have access to information and resources is largely associated with inclusion
    in the workplace, suggesting that analysis of individuals social networks may
    be an important component of this assessment. Network surveys provide a unique
    lens through which a wide range of networks, including networks of collaboration,
    mentorship, and trust, can be studied. As a result of such studies, efforts to
    improve on inclusivity can be directed towards where they are needed the most.
    Herein, we describe the NIST Interactions Survey a data collection tool developed
    for mapping and analyzing personal ego networks of NIST Federal Employees and
    aimed at quantifying the work- and career advice-related networks. In this study,
    we assess inclusivity at NIST through the lens of social network analysis to provide
    NIST with insights about the current work climate. With an overall response rate
    of approximately 25%, we find that the structure of the work- and advice-related
    ego networks provides important insights into the interaction patterns at NIST.
    An analysis of the network data confirms a siloed effect associated with the Organizational
    Unit affiliation of the respondents and their connections in the work and advice
    networks. Interestingly, we find that, while the composition of work ego networks
    tend to be quite aligned with what would be expected based on the workforce demographics,
    interactions in the advice ego networks reveal preferences associated with age
    and gender. In terms of gender, male employees show preference for male-dominated
    advice networks, which is not surprising given our predominantly male workforce.
    For female employees, however, we observe three distinct types of advice networks:
    two capturing strong preferences to seek advice from single-gender-dominated networks,
    be it male or female, and a third one with the gender composition quite evenly
    balanced. In terms of age preferences, we find that younger employees tend to
    seek advice from more experienced colleagues. Interestingly, no discernible differences
    are observed between the networks of minority and non-minority employees for either
    work or advice. Based on these findings, we recommend strategies for bridging
    the silos between the Laboratories and the rest of the Organizational Units, nurturing
    informal connections among female colleagues, and mapping employee networks among
    different minority groups (e.g. American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native
    Hawaiian, Other). Although other approaches are possible, we believe that the
    recommendations proposed in this report will be a good start for NIST to become
    the inclusive organization we aspire to be.'
