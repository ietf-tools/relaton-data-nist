abstract:
- content: Manufacturers are increasingly choosing wireless platforms to replace wired
    ones due to their ease of installation, upgrade, and reconfigurability. Reliable
    and secure real-time performance of wireless platforms is technically challenging
    because wireless data communication, reliability, and throughput can be easily
    affected by the physical environment in which the wireless platforms are operate.
    These effects need to be investigated and better understood through physics-based
    modeling, correlated with real-world measurements. To support U.S. manufacturers,
    the NIST Engineering Laboratory has launched a five-year project entitled Wireless
    Systems for Industrial Environments as part of the NIST Standards for Manufacturing
    Systems Program. The key idea for this project is to develop best-practice guidelines
    for integrated performance evaluation of secure wireless platforms in dynamic
    production systems. This will include a methodology for selecting wireless technology
    and protocols that will assure real-time performance of wireless platforms in
    various manufacturing environments. These guidelines will enable manufacturers,
    technology providers, and solution providers to design, deploy, and assess robust,
    secure integrated wireless solutions for use in smart manufacturing. As part of
    this project, NIST will be characterizing the wireless environment through measurements
    in representative production facilities.
