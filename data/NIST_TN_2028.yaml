abstract:
- content: The FireCARES (Community Assessment Response Evaluation System) project
    is a web-based tool intended to help fire departments effectively match resources
    to community risk. Among other things, the analysis includes estimates of the
    community risk and estimates of effectiveness of response. This report documents
    the estimation of the community risk for fires, fire injuries, fire deaths, and
    emergency medical services calls. The community risk for fires is broken out by
    low- medium- and high-hazard properties as defined in NFPA Standard 1710.
