abstract:
- content: The burning velocity of mixtures of the refrigerant R-32 (CH2F2) with air
    over a range of equivalence ratios are studied via spherically expanding flames
    SEFs in a large, optically accessible spherical chamber at constant pressure.
    Shadowgraph images from a high-speed video camera are analysed to yield flame
    radius as a function of time. Data reduction techniques are explored and direct
    numerical simulations of the flame are performed with the FlameMaster code, using
    detailed kinetics. The flame radius as a function of time is accurately predicted
    by the simulations. Flame stretch and thermal radiation (using an optically thin
    model) occur simultaneously and make extraction of the unstretched burning velocity
    from the experimental data difficult. For these low burning velocity flames, the
    numerical simulations show that stretch and radiation effects are particularly
    important, and different data reduction schemes can have large effects on the
    inferred burning velocity.
