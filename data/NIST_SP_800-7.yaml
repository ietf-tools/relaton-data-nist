abstract:
- content: The Public Switched Network (PSN) provides National Security and Emergency
    Preparedness (NS/EP) telecommunications. Service vendors, equipment manufacturers,
    and the federal government are concerned that vulnerabilities in the PSN could
    be exploited and result in disruptions or degradation of service. To address these
    threats, NIST is assisting the Office of the Manager, National Communications
    System (OMNCS), in the areas of computer and network security research and development.
    NIST is investigating the vulnerabilities and related security issues that result
    from the use of open systems platforms, i.e., products based on open standards
    such as POSIX and OSI, in the telecommunications industry. This report is intended
    to provide information for the practicing programmer involved in development of
    telecommunications application software. In short, it provides answers to the
    question, How do I build security into software based on open system platforms?
    It is not intended to be tutorial in nature and assumes some knowledge of open
    systems and Unix. Many of the references cited are tutorial and may be used to
    obtain any background information required.
