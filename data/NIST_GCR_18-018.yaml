abstract:
- content: This report documents twenty-one structures that were ignited or significantly
    damaged by burning wildland vegetation in Virginia over a two-year period starting
    in 2015. The structures included all of those that would have been lost except
    for the intervention of local fire departments or the Virginia Department of Forestry
    to suppress the fires. The objective of the study was to supply data to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from wildland-urban interface (WUI)
    fire sites where structures were ignited, including incident date, structure location,
    type of wildland vegetation that spread fire to the structure, and the first material
    ignited. Most of the incidents involved storage or utility buildings that were
    typically located away from residences where landscaped ground cover abutted a
    forested area on private property. Many of the structures ignited had wood or
    wood based exterior finish materials. Exterior finishes were burned and, in many
    cases burned through allowing fire to spread to the interior. In most cases, the
    fire was spread to the structure through leaves on the ground. In those incidents,
    ground leaf and tree litter cover sufficient to spread fire and ignite the structures
    was estimated to be between 8 cm and 13 cm (3 in and 5 in) deep. Video from the
    2016 Chalet Village WUI community fire (near Gatlinburg, Tennessee) showed that
    the same ignition mechanism played a role in the ignition of structures in that
    community.
