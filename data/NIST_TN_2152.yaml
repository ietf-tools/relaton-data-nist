abstract:
- content: Probability distribution fitting of an unknown stochastic process is an
    important preliminary step for any further analysis in science or engineering.
    However, it requires some background in statistics and prior considerations of
    the process or phenomenon under study. As such, this paper presents an alternative
    approach which doesn't require prior knowledge of statistical methods nor previous
    assumption on the available data. Instead, using Deep Learning, the correct distributional
    model is extracted from the output of a neural network that was previously trained
    on a large suitable dataset in order to classify any array of observations into
    a matching distributional model. We find that our classifier can perform this
    task comparably to using maximum likelihood estimation with an Anderson-Darling
    goodness of fit.
