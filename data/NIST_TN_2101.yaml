abstract:
- content: Two air-source, split system heat pumps were installed in a residential,
    net-zero energy home that was constructed as a laboratory on the campus of the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland
    USA. The first heat pump was a two-stage, 7 kW (2 ton), 15.8 seasonal energy efficiency
    ratio (SEER), 9.05 heating seasonal performance ratio (HSPF) conventionally ducted
    system, and the second heat pump was a variable-speed, 10.6 kW (3 ton), 14 SEER,
    8.35 HSPF, high velocity ducted system. These two systems operated side-by-side,
    using separate supply ducts and a common return duct, on a weekly alternating
    schedule to condition the home that was operated with very consistent, simulated
    thermal loads. We wanted to know if the high velocity system could provide comparable
    energy use efficiency to the conventional system. The results of this study showed
    that it did meet the required loads while doing so with slightly greater efficiency;
    the average cooling coefficient of performance (COP) was (0.40+/-0.11) higher,
    and the average heating COP was statistically equal. A new firmware was provided
    at the end of the heating season which greatly improved the performance of the
    high velocity system; its average heating COP went from (1.8+/-0.9) to (2.5+/-1.1)
    at a 95 % confidence level. The new firmware heating COP averaged (1.05+/-0.23)
    higher than the old firmware over the same outdoor temperatures. Defrost performance
    is very different for these two systems yet they consumed equivalent energy per
    HDD; the conventional system uses a timed-initiate, temperature-terminate algorithm
    with auxiliary electric resistive heating while the high velocity system uses
    calculated evaporator parameters with a hot-gas bypass before a full reverse cycle
    defrost with no supplementary resistive heat.
