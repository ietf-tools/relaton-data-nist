abstract:
- content: This report provides technical documentation of how NIST reconstructed
    the effects of the events on September 11, 2001 on WTC 7. This includes how the
    fires that followed the impact of debris from the collapse of WTC 1 (the north
    tower) led to the collapse of WTC 7; an evaluation of the building evacuation
    and emergency response procedures; what procedures and practices were used in
    the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the building; and areas
    in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision.
    This report also describes how NIST reached its conclusions. NIST complemented
    in-house expertise with private sector technical experts; accumulated copious
    documents, photographs, and videos of the disaster; conducted first-person interviews
    of building occupants and emergency responders; analyzed the evacuation and emergency
    response operations in and around WTC 7; performed computer simulations of the
    behavior of WTC 7 on September 11, 2001; and combined the knowledge gained into
    a probable collapse sequence.
