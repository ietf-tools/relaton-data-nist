abstract:
- content: This report documents a series of time-averaged gas species measurements
    made along the centerline of methanol, ethanol, acetone, methane, and propane
    pool fires steadily burning in a quiescent environment. All gas species measurements
    are obtained using a Gas Chromatograph/ Mass Spectrometer System (GC/MS) for gas
    samples extracted at various heights above the fire and repeated at least twice
    at each location. Gas species volume fractions are determined via the GC/MS using
    predetermined calibration factors. Soot mass fractions are simultaneously measured
    during the gas sampling process. The gas species volume and soot mass fractions
    are compared at different heights within the fire and across a variety of different
    fuels. Other fire parameters are measured as well, including time-averaged temperature
    and velocity measurements and mass burning rates.
