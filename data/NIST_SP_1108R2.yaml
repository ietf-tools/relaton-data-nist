abstract:
- content: The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 requires that NIST
    develop a framework of standards for the Smart Grid. This document is the second
    release of the framework first published in January, 2010. It covers the activities
    and outputs of the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel(SGIP), which is a public-private
    partnership to support development of this NIST framework. It includes progress
    on and plans for further development of the Conceptual Architectural Framework;
    an update to the list of standards identified by NIST and the SGIP for the Smart
    Grid; a description of the SGIP organization, its activities, processes, and working
    groups, including the Priority Action Plans for addressing Smart Grid standards
    gaps and overlaps; cybersecurity strategy and plans for and work products of the
    SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG); development of a framework for interoperability
    testing and certification, including the Interoperability Process Reference Manual
    (IPRM); and a discussion of the next steps in the development of the NIST interoperability
    framework.
