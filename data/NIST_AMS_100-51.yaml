abstract:
- content: 'Industrial users of ISO 10303 STandard for the Exchange of Product Model
    Data (STEP) protocols needed the ability to exchange design product data that
    is in conformance with recently updated ISO geometric product specification (GPS)
    standards, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) dimensioning and
    tolerancing standard, and recently updated digital product data definition practice
    standards. Updates to those standards were made to support continued migration
    from drawing-based product and manufacturing information (PMI) exchange to full
    model-based exchange, sharing and management across life-cycle viewpoints (i.e.,
    design to fabrication to inspection). The aerospace and automotive industries
    created a joint project to merge ISO 10303-203: Configuration controlled 3D design
    (AP 203) [1] and ISO 10303-214: Core data for automotive mechanical design processes
    (AP 214) [2] into a new ISO 10303-242: Managed model-based 3D engineering (AP
    242) [3] rather than pursue individual updates. Relevant STEP information models
    have been updated and new information models created to support the ASME and ISO
    standards, resulting in the publication of AP 242 in 2014.'
