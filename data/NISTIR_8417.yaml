abstract:
- content: This report details the third annual, full-day workshop exploring the state-of-practice
    in the metrology necessary for repeatably and independently assessing the performance
    of robotic systems in real-world human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. This
    workshop continues the aims of shortening the lead time between the theory and
    applications of HRI, enabling reproducible studies, and accelerating the adoption
    of cutting-edge technologies as the industry state-of-practice. The workshop was
    held on March 12, 2021, as part of the virtual ACM/IEEE International Conference
    on Human-Robot Interaction. This third installment of the annual workshop, 'Test
    Methods and Metrics for Effective HRI,' seeks to identify novel and emerging test
    methods and metrics for the holistic assessment and assurance of HRI performance.
    The focus is on identifying innovative metrics and test methods for the evaluation
    of HRI performance, and to advance the growth of the HRI community based on the
    principles of collaboration, data sharing, and repeatability. The goal of this
    workshop is to aid in the advancement of HRI technologies through the development
    of experimental design, test methods, and metrics for assessing interaction and
    interface designs.
