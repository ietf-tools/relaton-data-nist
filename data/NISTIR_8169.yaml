abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established
    a Vitamin D Metabolites Quality Assurance Program (VitDQAP) in collaboration with
    the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements. Participants
    in the twelfth exercise of this program, the Summer 2016 Comparability Study,
    were asked to use the methodology of their choice to measure concentrations of
    25-hydroxyvitamin D in pooled human serum control and study materials distributed
    by NIST. The study materials consisted of candidate SRM 968f Fat-Soluble Vitamins
    in Human Serum, Level 1 (SRM 968f L1), and Level 2 (SRM 968f L2). Standard Reference
    Material (SRM) 968d Fat-Soluble Vitamins, Carotenoids, and Cholesterol in Human
    Serum Level 1 was provided as a control material. Participants provided their
    data to NIST, where it was compiled and evaluated for trueness relative to the
    NIST value and concordance within the participant community. A report of results
    was provided to all participants of the study, and laboratories were identified
    by code numbers known only to them. The results from this twelfth study are reported
    along with a summary of the analytical methods used.
