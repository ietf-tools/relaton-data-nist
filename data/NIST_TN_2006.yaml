abstract:
- content: An eight-laboratory study provided the data to evaluate variability in
    tensile mechanical properties of cobalt-chrome alloy (UNS R31538) made by metals-based
    additive manufacturing. In the study, six laboratories employed laser powder-bed-fusion
    additive manufacturing, and two additional laboratories employed electron-beam
    powder-bed fusion. For the fve laboratories that employed nominally identical
    laser powder-bed fusion systems, the between-laboratory variability in yield strength
    and tensile strength was several times larger than the within-laboratory variability.
    Microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy revealed that each
    laboratory produced slightly different microstructures. Thermodynamic modeling
    of the solidifcation and subsequent post-build heat treating demonstrated that
    the fnal microstructure is sensitive to the exact heat-treating conditions.
