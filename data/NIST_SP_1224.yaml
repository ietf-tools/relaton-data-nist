abstract:
- content: 'The performance of a building and its functionality after a natural hazard
    event depend on multiple factors, including the original design and the current
    condition and capacity of the building to resist the risks posed by hazards. Building
    functionality also depends on the condition of the supporting infrastructure and
    the availability of utilities supplied to the building. Rapid recovery or uninterrupted
    operation of buildings can minimize disruptions to the community, decrease costs
    associated with repair and rebuilding, and lessen the overall economic burdens
    on communities and individuals impacted by natural hazards. However, given the
    range of age and condition of buildings across a community, there are often situations
    where the built environment does not perform well during natural hazard events.
    To address this gap between current and desired performance of buildings, Congress
    tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to identify research
    needs and implementation activities that would help improve building performance
    in case of a natural hazard. This mandate would expand the application of immediate
    occupancy performance beyond critical buildings, such as hospitals, to other buildings
    that are important to residents, businesses, and the broader community. With a
    longstanding focus on preserving lives, building codes help reduce the likelihood
    of significant damage or structural collapse and provide some degree of property
    protection. But current codes generally do not address continued functionality
    after a hazard event. With the damage and losses the nation and communities have
    been experiencing following natural hazard events, there is interest in understanding
    what would be required to move beyond the current design paradigm to include functionality.
    For example, an apartment building may be uninhabitable after an earthquake due
    to expected structural damage or after a wind hazard event due to damage to the
    building envelope. The resulting economic and social disruption caused by the
    displacement of residents is significant and is compounded when residential and
    commercial buildings across the community are similarly damaged. To address this
    problem and move toward development of a new immediate occupancy performance objective,
    this report identifies a large portfolio of research and implementation activities
    that target enhanced performance objectives for residential and commercial buildings.
    This exploratory report provides information about steps that could be taken;
    NIST is not charged with making recommendations about the desirability, practicality,
    or government or private sector resources that would be needed to carry out these
    actions if a decision is made to give immediate occupancy greater attention. These
    potential activities developed by NIST were aided by a steering committee of individual
    experts and informed by additional stakeholder input, including a national workshop
    hosted by NIST in January 2018. Four primary topic areas were identified: 1) building
    design, 2) community considerations, 3) economic and social considerations, and
    4) acceptance and adoption considerations. If a decision is made to advance immediate
    occupancy performance goals, these topics need to be addressed concurrently through
    cooperative efforts among researchers, engineers, standards and code officials,
    and community stakeholders to reach the next level of building design and performance.'
