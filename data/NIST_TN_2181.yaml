abstract:
- content: Customers and transactive energy (TE) market managers may rely on load
    forecasting algorithms to purchase or sell power in a forward market environment,
    using day-ahead and real-time pricing structures. Accurate load forecasting becomes
    necessary when a local controller or aggregator interacts with a market to purchase
    energy for future use. This study introduces a load forecasting tool (LFT) that
    estimates the next-day energy consumption of residential house models in GridLAB
    D. The LFT is an integral part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) TE simulation testbed which provides a platform for conducting TE experiments.
    The LFT is comprised of two main components, a learning algorithm and a load forecasting
    algorithm utilizing a first-order lumped capacitance model to forecast the next
    day indoor temperature and energy consumption. The lumped capacitance model simulates
    the thermal characteristics of a residential house in response to heat gains or
    losses due to the heat pump operation and other environmental conditions, such
    as outdoor air temperature and solar irradiance. The learning algorithm uses simulated
    indoor temperature from GridLAB-D and historical weather data for Tucson Arizona
    to estimate critical parameters of a residential house such as thermal time constant,
    solar heat gain coefficient, effective window area, and the heat pump coefficient
    of performance. The load forecasting algorithm utilizes these parameters to optimize
    the operation of a residential heat pump while minimizing cost and maintaining
    thermal comfort. The load forecasting algorithm resulted in average energy savings
    of 9.4 % and average cost savings of 19.4 % compared to simulated baseline energy
    consumption in GridLAB-D. The LFT s forecast temperature and energy consumption
    profiles have been integrated into a co-simulation experiment for validation.
