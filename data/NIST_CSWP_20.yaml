abstract:
- content: NIST Special Publication 800-207 defines zero trust as a set of cybersecurity
    principles used when planning and implementing an enterprise architecture. These
    principles apply to endpoints, services, and data flows. Input and cooperation
    from various stakeholders in an enterprise is needed for a zero trust architecture
    to succeed in improving the enterprise security posture. Some of these stakeholders
    may not be familiar with risk analysis and management. This document provides
    an overview of the NIST Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) and how the NIST
    RMF can be applied when developing and implementing a zero trust architecture.
