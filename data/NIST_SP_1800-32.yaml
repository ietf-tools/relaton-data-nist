abstract:
- content: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the application of instrumentation
    and connected sensors and other devices to machinery and vehicles in the transport,
    energy, and other critical infrastructure sectors. In the energy sector, distributed
    energy resources (DERs) such as solar photovoltaics including sensors, data transfer
    and communications systems, instruments, and other commercially available devices
    that are networked together. DERs introduce information exchanges between a utility's
    distribution control system and the DERs to manage the flow of energy in the distribution
    grid.
