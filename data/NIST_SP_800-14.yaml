abstract:
- content: As more organizations share information electronically, a common understanding
    of what is needed and expected in securing information technology (IT) resources
    is required. This document provides a baseline that organizations can use to establish
    and review their IT security programs. The document gives a foundation that organizations
    can reference when conducting multi-organizational business as well as internal
    business. Management, internal auditors, users, system developers, and security
    practioners can use the guideline to gain an understanding of the basic security
    requirements most IT systems should contain. The foundation begins with generally
    accepted system security principles and continues with common practices that are
    used in securing IT systems.
