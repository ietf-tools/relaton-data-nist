abstract:
- content: Statistical properties such as the spectral density and spatial coherence
    of boundary layer turbulence affect bluff body aerodynamics and structural responses.
    In this report, the open-source toolbox OpenFOAM is employed to perform LES simulations
    of boundary layer flows with rough ground and to obtain turbulence statistics.
    The one-equation-eddy SGS model is used for the subgrid-scale motions while the
    wall shear model is applied at the ground. The mean velocity profiles follow the
    logarithmic law except the near-ground region owing to the limited accuracy of
    the SGS model. The Reynolds stresses, the third-order moments and the energy budgets
    are reasonably well represented. The power spectra agree with the modified Kaimal
    expressions at low frequencies. Additional research is planned on the simulation
    of higher frequency turbulence spectra. The spatial coherence functions are exponential
    and consistent with the expressions commonly used in wind engineering applications.
