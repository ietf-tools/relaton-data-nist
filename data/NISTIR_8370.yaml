abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been collaborating
    with the San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI) since 2009, providing biobanking
    services at the NIST Biorepository in Charleston, South Carolina, in support of
    their ongoing water quality monitoring program, the Regional Monitoring Program
    for Water Quality in the San Francisco Bay (RMP). Specimens (bivalve tissue, bird
    egg contents, fish tissue and sediment) are collected and processed by SFEI-partnering
    institutions according to their established protocols and shipped to the NIST
    Biorepository for archiving. This report outlines NIST s role in the project,
    describes collection and processing protocols developed by SFEI and their collaborators,
    details shipping and archival procedures employed by biorepository staff and provides
    an inventory of the collection maintained by NIST from 2009 to 2020.
