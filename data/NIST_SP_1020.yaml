abstract:
- content: This document, 'Guide for Labeling Consumer Packages by Weight, Volume,
    Count, or Measure (length, area, or thickness),'' is based on the Uniform Packaging
    and Labeling Regulation (UPLR) in National Institute of Standards and Technology
    Handbook 130, 'Uniform Laws and Regulation in the Areas of Legal Metrology and
    Fuel Quality.'' It provides a summary of labeling requirements for consumer products
    and commodities sold by weight, volume, count, or measure. This guide is not a
    replacement for the UPLR. The reader should refer to the UPLR to ensure that all
    requirements are met. This guide does not apply to wine, malted beverages and
    distilled spirits, some packages of meat and poultry products subject to the label
    requirements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and to packages labeled for
    export.
