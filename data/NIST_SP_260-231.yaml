- content: The certified mass fractions delivered by Standard Reference Material (SRM)
    1270a are intended primarily for use in validation of chemical and instrumental
    methods of analysis for element contents of iron and steel alloys. They can be
    used to validate value assignment of a laboratory's in-house reference materials.
    A unit of SRM 1270a consists of one disk approximately 32 mm in diameter and 19
    mm thick.
