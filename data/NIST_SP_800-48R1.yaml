abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to organizations in
    securing their legacy Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
    802.11 wireless local area networks (WLAN) that cannot use IEEE 802.11i. The document
    provides an overview of legacy IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards, components, and architectural
    models. It discusses the basics of WLAN security and examines the security capabilities
    provided by legacy IEEE 802.11 standards. The document also discusses threats
    and vulnerabilities involving legacy IEEE 802.11 WLANs, explains common countermeasures,
    and makes recommendations for their use.
