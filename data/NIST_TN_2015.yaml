abstract:
- content: The Data Alignment Tool (DAT) was built to assist with the analysis of
    data used in testing fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) tools and building
    commissioning (Cx) tools. The data sources were the Virtual Cybernetic Building
    Testbed (VCBT) [1] and data collected from real buildings. The raw data processed
    by the DAT typically spanned multiple input files, and was not in a format appropriate
    for the analysis tools. The features provided by the DAT were implemented to address
    the specific needs of the tools being tested, but should also be applicable to
    a wide range of other uses. The DAT can read data from one or more data files,
    perform several useful operations on it, and save it with a variety of options.
    The operations implemented include combining subsets of columns from multiple
    data files into one output file, reducing data by modifying the time span between
    data points, performing unit conversions, and filtering data by time of day. Output
    file operations include a column filter or splitting out files by date. As a manual
    process, each of these operations would be time consuming, tedious and error prone.
    The DAT largely automates these operations.
