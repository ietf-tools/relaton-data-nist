abstract:
- content: Channel modeling often provides a basis for the design and deployment of
    wireless technology. Engineers design systems to operate under certain expected
    channel conditions. Channel models are typically based on the statistics of a
    collection of many measurements performed by channel sounders in nominally similar
    radio-propagation environments. Channel sounders measure characteristics of a
    radio propagation channel such as path gain, decay time, and angular dispersion,
    among other channel model metrics. The models developed from these measurements
    are typically the first step in standardizing a new wireless technology. While
    many such models currently exist, wireless technology for new use cases is constantly
    under development, necessitating continued development of new and improved channel
    models. For example, in the 3550 MHz to 3650 MHz (3.5 GHz) band, rules for spectrum
    sharing and systems for implementing those rules are being developed based on
    specific channel models. Success of the spectrum sharing systems will, in part,
    depend on the accuracy of those models. As another example, it is anticipated
    that other next-generation wireless systems will operate in the millimeter-wave
    bands. Here, developing new channel models will be of paramount importance due
    to the significantly different impact of the propagation phenomena at these higher
    frequencies. At both microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies, separating measurement
    uncertainty from channel variations provides rigor for channel-model development
    and validation. Such measurement uncertainties can be caused by systematic hardware
    nonidealities, system noise, and the repeatability and reproducibility of the
    measurements.
