abstract:
- content: The purpose of this publication is to provide appropriate and useful guidelines
    for accrediting the reliability of issuers of Personal Identity Verification cards
    that are established to collect, store, and disseminate personal identity credentials
    and issue smart cards, based on the standards published in response to Homeland
    Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12). These issuers, who are the target
    of assessment and accreditation, are called Personal Identity Verification Card
    Issuers or PCIs. The reliability of PCIs is of utmost importance when one organization
    (e.g., a Federal agency or Federal contractor) is required to trust the identity
    credentials and cards of individuals that were created and issued, respectively,
    by another organization. This trust will only exist if organizations relying on
    the credentials and cards issued by a given organization have the necessary level
    of assurance that the reliability of the issuing organization has been established
    through a formal accreditation process. This publication provides an assessment
    and accreditation methodology for verifying that issuers of PIV credentials and
    cards are reliably adhering to standards and implementation directives developed
    under HSPD-12.
