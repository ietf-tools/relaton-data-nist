abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to Federal agencies
    on how to select cryptographic controls for protecting Sensitive Unclassified1
    information. This document focuses on Federal standards documented in Federal
    Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBs) and the cryptographic
    modules and algorithms that are validated against these standards. However, to
    provide additional information, other standards organizations, (e.g., American
    National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO)) are briefly discussed.
