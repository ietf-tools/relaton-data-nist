abstract:
- content: A data reduction tool was developed to conveniently post-process spherical
    constant volume flame experiments. Such experiments are employed to obtain laminar
    flame velocities in a premixed gas mixture. The setup is relatively simple and
    the only recorded physical quantities are pressure and time. Under various model
    assumption this so called pressure trace can be used to deduce the flame velocity.
    Many such models with different levels of complexity are available in the literature.
    One category of models are the shell models where the vessel content is divided
    in grid shells and the flame history is reconstructed employing physical models.
    Three of those shell models are implemented in the present tool. This technical
    note describes the installation and provides a user guide with additional details
    about the models and the algorithms. Its purpose is to help users efficiently
    use the tool and obtain physically meaningful results.
