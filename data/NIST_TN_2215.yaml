- content: PRIMARY AUDIENCE Fire protection and fire probabilistic risk assessment
    engineers conducting or reviewing fire modeling that supports fire probabilistic
    risk assessments related to characteristics (e.g., ignition, fire growth, and
    peak heat release rate) of electrical enclosure fires in nuclear power plants.
    KEY RESEARCH QUESTION What are the characteristics (e.g., common causes, ignition
    mechanisms, detection type) of electrical enclosure fires; what impact does fire
    cause type have on the severity, duration, and damage type of electrical enclosure
    fires; and how does this vary for fires in electrical enclosures versus all fires
    in nuclear power plants? can this information be used to inform testing, fire
    modeling, and risk assessment of electrical enclosure fires?
