abstract:
- content: Buildings as a set of electric loads and generation resources can play
    an essential role in managing the stability of the power system in a smart grid.
    Traditionally, buildings assumed a passive rule in the day-to-day operation of
    the electric grid. Utilities control the supply of energy to match the demand
    for buildings. However, the dynamics of the power distribution grid are rapidly
    changing. A critical aspect of managing the balance between supply and demand
    in the distribution grid is estimating future demand through load forecasting.
    Loading forecasting requires accurate, adaptive, and simple models to account
    for the dynamic behavior of the electrical demand. In residential buildings, heat
    pumps are a significant source of energy consumption. This document describes
    a novel gray-box model (RL Model) to forecast a two-stage air-source heat pump's
    steady-state and transient current consumption in heating and cooling seasons.
    The RL Model is based on the solution of a first-order differential equation describing
    the characteristics of a resistor-inductor equivalent circuit and the steady-state
    power consumption of a heat pump. The steady-state power consumption of the heat
    pump is a strong function of the outdoor temperature. Key parameters of the RL
    Model were estimated using a learning algorithm. The performance of the RL Model
    is validated using measurement data from the Net-Zero Energy Residential Test
    Facility located on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    campus in Gaithersburg, MD. The predicted output of the RL Model, current consumption,
    is used to estimate the heat pump's real and reactive power consumption for different
    operating stages and seasons. A list of key parameters, like the time constant
    and temperature-dependent coefficients of the RL Model, are tabulated. Knowledge
    of the time constant provides critical information for analyzing the aggregated
    effect of controlling many heat pumps, as flexible loads, on grid stability and
    provision of ancillary services. The average root mean squared error between the
    RL Model's predicted current output and the measured current consumption is 0.06.
