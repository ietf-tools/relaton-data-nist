abstract:
- content: A previous report, NIST Technical Note 1734, Airflow and Indoor Air Quality
    Models of DOE Reference Commercial Buildings [1], detailed the CONTAM models of
    the 16 U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) reference commercial building models [2].
    DOE developed the EnergyPlus building models for use in assessing new technologies
    and supporting the development of energy codes in pursuing building energy efficiency
    improvements. The DOE commercial reference buildings were developed to represent
    buildings that were constructed before 1980, constructed between 1980-2003, and
    constructed in 2004. Further details on the DOE reference building models can
    be found in Deru, et al. (2). Since the release of the DOE reference building
    models, updates have been made by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
    so that the modeled buildings comply with newer versions of ASHRAE Standard 90.1
    Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings [3] and the
    International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) [4]. These building models are referred
    to as the prototype buildings, rather than the reference buildings. Thus, NIST
    Technical Note 1734 is updated in this report to reflect the changes to the CONTAM
    models to match the prototype buildings that comply with ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013.
    Updates to the NIST Technical Note 1734 are denoted by red text in this document.
    In general, the building geometry and layout of the prototype buildings are the
    same as the reference buildings, with minor changes to the layout of the Large
    Office only. In addition, both the reference and prototype building models contain
    16 building types. However, the reference buildings include a Supermarket while
    the prototype buildings include a Highrise Apartment. DOE did not provide reasoning
    for excluding a Supermarket from the prototype set [5]. All CONTAM models of the
    prototype buildings required updates to the building envelope airtightness, ventilation
    airflow rates, ventilation system operation, occupancy, and thermostat setpoint
    schedules.
