abstract:
- content: The purpose of this report is to present the experimental data on 1046
    Mc obtained at the Cheyenne Mountain Field Station for the period February 1,
    1952 through January 31, 1953. Continuous recordings were not made prior to this
    period and consequently any previous data are not considered. In addition, this
    report includes the analysis of diurnal and seasonal variations in hourly median
    signal levels, the analysis of variations in instantaneous signal levels and the
    analysis of prolonged space-wave fade-outs within the radio horizon for the period
    investigated, an analysis of the effects of irregular terrain at points within
    the radio horizon, an analysis of the scattered signals at points far beyond the
    radio horizon, including estimates of the expected effective gains of large antenna
    arrays, the required spacing for diversity arrays and the effective intelligence
    bearing bandwidths of the propagation paths. Finally, as a result of a recent
    investigation of propagation over high mountain ridges, an analysis is presented
    of the obstacle gains expected on 1000 Mc in mountainous terrain.
