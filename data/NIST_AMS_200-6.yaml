abstract:
- content: This guide describes how to use the STEP File Analyzer and Viewer, a software
    tool that analyzes and generates a spreadsheet or a set of CSV (comma-separated
    value) files from a STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data) file.
    The spreadsheets simplify inspecting information in the STEP file at an entity
    and attribute level. STEP files can also be checked for conformance to recommended
    practices for Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) representation, PMI
    presentation, and validation properties. The STEP File Analyzer and Viewer also
    generates visualizations of boundary representation part geometry, graphical PMI
    annotations, tessellated part geometry, supplemental geometry, and finite element
    models.
