abstract:
- content: The NIST Dietary Supplement Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (DSQAP)
    was established in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
    Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2007 to enable members of the dietary supplement
    community to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance
    with various regulations, including the dietary supplement current good manufacturing
    practices (cGMPs). Exercise N of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories
    to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (chromium), contaminants
    (arsenic, cadmium, and lead), water-soluble vitamins (folic acid), fat soluble
    vitamins (vitamin D2 and vitamin D3), fatty acids, and botanical marker compounds
    (ginsenosides) in foods and/or botanical dietary supplement ingredients and finished
    products.
