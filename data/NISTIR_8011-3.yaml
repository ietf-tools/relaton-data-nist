abstract:
- content: The NISTIR 8011 volumes focus on each individual information security capability,
    adding tangible detail to the more general overview given in NISTIR 8011 Volume
    1, and providing a template for transition to a detailed, NIST standards-compliant
    automated assessment. This document, Volume 3 of NISTIR 8011, addresses the Software
    Asset Management (SWAM) information security capability. The focus of the SWAM
    capability is to manage risk created by unmanaged software on a network. Unmanaged
    software is a target that attackers can use as a platform from which to attack
    components on the network.
