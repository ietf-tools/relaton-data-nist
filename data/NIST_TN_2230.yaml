abstract:
- content: In the framework of a collaborative project between ASME, NASA, and NIST,
    quasi-static fracture toughness tests have been performed at liquid nitrogen temperature
    (77 K, or -196 C) and liquid helium temperature (4 K, or -269 C) on weld specimens
    extracted from the centers of four 316L welded stainless steel plates, each produced
    by a different vendor. Although the plates were produced in accordance with the
    same specifications from the same material (316L), large differences in fracture
    toughness have been observed, with the best weld (W2) exhibiting twice the critical
    toughness of the worst (W1) at 77 K, and more than seven times the critical toughness
    of W1 at 4 K. The Charpy absorbed energies recorded at 77 K for three of the welds
    within the same project were found to be strongly linearly correlated with fracture
    toughness at both test temperatures. The exception was weld W4, which provided
    the highest impact toughness and the second lowest quasi-static fracture toughness
    (stable crack initiation and resistance to crack propagation).
