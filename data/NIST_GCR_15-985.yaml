abstract:
- content: 'Fire resistance of timber structures is a very large field. In order to
    keep this document relatively small, the scope of is limited as follows: This
    report attempts to define a Performance-Based framework for the fire safety design
    of multi-story timber buildings. The report concentrates on medium-rise multi-story
    timber buildings from 3 stories to 10 stories tall, which are likely to be most
    popular and technical feasible. Taller buildings are discussed briefly. The report
    concentrates on mass timber buildings, constructed from large timber posts and
    beams (from LVL or glulam) and large wood panel construction using cross-laminated
    timber (CLT) or other heavy timber panels. Light wood frame buildings protected
    with gypsum plasterboard (2 by 4 construction) have been covered elsewhere and
    are not considered to be feasible for building above about 6 stories. The report
    concentrates on the fire resistance of structural elements and assemblies, and
    does not include early fire safety issues such as ignition and flame-spread on
    wood surfaces. It does not address broader fire safety issues such as fire safety
    systems, fire fighting, or evacuation. External fire spread via building facades
    and windows is partly included, since wooden fa ade claddings are considered by
    many architects to be an essential feature of timber buildings, at least up to
    8-10 stories. Automatic fire sprinkler systems are discussed briefly, since the
    combination of active and passive fire protection is considered to be an important
    way to provide fire safety for tall timber buildings. Fire resistance of timber
    connections is included briefly, including both mechanical fasteners and glued
    connections. The influence of adhesives on the fire behaviour of bonded structural
    timber elements is discussed briefly.'
