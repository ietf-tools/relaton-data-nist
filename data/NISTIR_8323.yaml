abstract:
- content: The national and economic security of the United States (US) is dependent
    upon the reliable functioning of the nation’s critical infrastructure. Positioning,
    Navigation, and Timing (PNT) services are widely deployed throughout this infrastructure.
    In a government wide effort to mitigate the potential impacts of a PNT disruption
    or manipulation, Executive Order (EO)13905, Strengthening National Resilience
    Through Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation and Timing Services was issued
    on February 12, 2020. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    as part of the Department of Commerce (DoC), produced this voluntary PNT Profile
    in response to Sec.4 Implementation (a), as detailed in the EO. The PNT Profile
    was created by using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and can be used as part
    of a risk management program to help organizations manage risks to systems, networks,
    and assets that use PNT services. The PNT Profile is intended to be broadly applicable
    and can serve as a foundation for the development of sector-specific guidance.
    This PNT Profile provides a flexible framework for users of PNT to manage risks
    when forming and using PNT signals and data, which are susceptible to disruptions
    and manipulations that can be natural, manufactured, intentional, or unintentional.
