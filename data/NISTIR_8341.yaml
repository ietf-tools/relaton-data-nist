abstract:
- content: 'In February 2020, Office of Data and Informatics Group Lead Gretchen Greene
    asked Metadata Librarian Andrea Medina-Smith to perform a CoreTrustSeal (CTS)
    self-audit of the Public Data Repository (PDR) in preparation for submitting an
    application for the CoreTrustSeal Certification. This certification is a lightweight,
    but thorough assessment of a given data repository''s policies, documentation,
    and technical infrastructure supporting 16 required elements of assessment. The
    requirements are broadly split into the following themes: background information,
    organizational infrastructure, digital object management, and technology. These
    elements together form a picture of the trustworthiness of the data repository.
    The following self-audit report is a snapshot of where the PDR stands as of August
    2020.'
