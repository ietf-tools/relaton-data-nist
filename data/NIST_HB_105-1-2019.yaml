abstract:
- content: These specifications and tolerances establish the minimum requirements
    for Field Standards used by State and local weights and measures officials and
    others in the regulatory verification of weighing devices used in quantity determination
    of commodities sold by weight. Non-Weights and Measures users may find this handbook
    helpful in the design of field standard weights, but the requirements should not
    be considered mandatory for special applications outside of the scope of regulatory
    weights and measures. The Handbook 105 series of publications are the specifications
    and tolerances for reference standards and field standards used in weights and
    measures (legal metrology) applications. This Handbook 105-1 is the first in the
    series and is specific for the application of weights used for testing scales
    for compliance to NIST Handbook 44, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical
    Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices.
