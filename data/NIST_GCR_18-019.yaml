abstract:
- content: In today's structure fires, evolving fire loads and higher heat release
    rates mean that fires grow larger and faster than ever before. Firefighting personal
    protective equipment (PPE) can be subjected to these severe thermal conditions
    repeatedly during firefighting operations. The self-contained breathing apparatus
    (SCBA) is a critical component of PPE that isolates the firefighter from hot and
    potentially toxic gases and particulate, present as byproducts of combustion.
    In recent years, changes in NFPA standards have resulted in the introduction of
    new SCBA facepiece designs and materials. However, the facepiece lens is still
    often considered the weak-link of the firefighting ensemble. SCBA facepiece lenses
    from two editions of the NFPA 1981 standard around which significant new tests
    were introduced were exposed to repeated thermal loads similar to those that could
    be encountered on a fireground (5 kW/m2 for 5 minutes for 100 cycles, and 10 kW/m2
    for 1.5 minutes for 10 cycles). Samples from subsets of these SCBA were subjected
    to quasistatic tensile tests and dynamic impact testing and compared to samples
    from new, unexposed facepieces. Identical facepiece samples were subjected to
    the NFPA 1981 Lens Radiant Heat Test that was introduced in the 2013 version of
    the standard, which drove much of the change in facepiece design. Finally, facepiece
    lenses were tested for potential off-gassing that was proposed to be the result
    of polycarbonate decomposition from typical fireground thermal loads, due to the
    concern that these gasses could be inhaled by the firefighter wearing the SCBA
    facepiece. Statistically significant differences were found between facepieces
    certified to different versions of NFPA 1981. Those lenses certified to the 2013
    edition had higher tensile strength and absorbed more energy but were more brittle
    than the 2007 edition materials. Exposure to repeated thermal loads resulted in
    changes to the tensile strength, strain to failure, maximal load, and energy absorbed,
    but the magnitude and direction of change was dependent on the thermal exposure
    and lens model. However, regardless of model and previous thermal exposure, all
    facepieces were able to maintain positive pressure after being exposed to the
    5 minutes at 15 kW/m2 that is included in the Lens Radiant Heat Test. Off-gas
    testing from the SCBA facepiece lenses showed no measurable polymers being released
    under typical and extreme fireground conditions using the GC-MS technique employed.
    Chemically dissolving the lens material confirmed that bisphenol A was a primary
    component of the polycarbonate along with important polymer chain terminators,
    and trace amounts of other polymers used in scratch resistant and thermal coatings.
