    Exchange of Product model data) Part 21 file and (1) generates a spreadsheet or
    CSV files of all entity and attribute information, (2) creates a visualization
    (view) of part geometry, sketch geometry, graphical PMI annotations, supplemental
    geometry, and datum targets that is displayed in a web browser, (3) reports and
    analyzes any semantic PMI, graphical PMI, and validation properties for conformance
    to recommended practices, and (4) checks for basic STEP file format errors.
