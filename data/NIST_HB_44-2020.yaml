abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 44 was first published in 1949, having been preceded by similar
    handbooks of various designations and in several forms, beginning in 1918. NIST
    Handbook 44 is published in its entirety each year following the Annual Meeting
    of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM). The Committee on Specifications
    and Tolerances of the NCWM developed the 2019 edition with the assistance of the
    Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) of the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST). This handbook includes amendments endorsed by the 104th National
    Conference on Weights and Measures during its Annual Meeting in 2019. NIST has
    a statutory responsibility for cooperation with the states in securing uniformity
    of weights and measures laws and methods of inspection. In partial fulfillment
    of this responsibility, NIST is pleased to publish these recommendations of the
    NCWM. This handbook conforms to the concept of primary use of SI (metric) measurements
    recommended in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 by citing SI
    units before U.S. customary units where both units appear together and placing
    separate sections containing requirements in SI units before corresponding sections
    containing requirements in U.S. customary units. In some cases, however, trade
    practice is currently restricted to the use of U.S. customary units; therefore,
    some requirements in this handbook will continue to specify only U.S. customary
    units until the NCWM achieves a broad consensus on the permitted SI units. In
    accord with NIST policy, the meter/liter spellings are used in this document.
    However, the metre/litre spellings are acceptable, and are preferred by the NCWM.
