abstract:
- content: 'Augmented Reality (AR) is an enhanced version of reality created by the
    use of technology to overlay digital information on an image of something being
    viewed through a device. AR has potential uses in many fields such as education,
    retail, repair/maintenance, manufacturing, and gaming. Any well-conducted and
    well-planned product development project should follow an iterative human-centered
    process. Throughout the development lifecycle, usability evaluations should be
    conducted to ensure that the product can be used by specified users to achieve
    specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified
    context of use. This AR Usability Evaluation Framework provides guidance on planning
    user-based usability evaluations of AR technology. While this report demonstrates
    the framework using a firefighting scenario in the public safety domain, the framework
    is applicable and can be expanded to other domains where users-based AR usability
    evaluations will be performed. Applying the framework in AR development lifecycles
    will provide the following benefits: Creating explicit structures for user-based
    evaluations Providing a consistent terminology and an initial set of usability
    metrics Facilitating comparability across AR research and development efforts
    Facilitating sharing of usability evaluation results Facilitating establishing
    human-centered AR design guidelines This report provides a five-component AR Usability
    Evaluation Framework to facilitate planning usability evaluations systematically
    to ensure successful evaluations and collecting useful usability data for product
    improvement. It will help reduce development cost and bring the product faster
    to market while providing good usability for users that are easy, quick, comfortable,
    and safe to use with minimal errors.'
