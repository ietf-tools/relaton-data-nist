abstract:
- content: This is the first of three reports describing a study designed to assess
    the feasibility of utilizing small-scale measurements in a cone calorimeter as
    inputs for predicting the burning (flaming) behavior of real-scale residential
    upholstered furniture (RUF). Here the focus is the experimental approach and results
    for the real-scale experiments. A literature review provides the rationale for
    our interest in RUF and summarizes previous efforts to characterize and regulate
    its burning behavior. The RUF items considered are mockups consisting of four
    cushions arranged in a chair configuration and mounted on a metal stand. The effects
    on burning behavior of changes in five types of materials - Fire Barrier, Polyurethane
    Foam, Polyester Fiber Wrap, Upholstery Cover Fabric, and Sewing Thread - previously
    identified as possibly affecting RUF burning are considered. Four of the material
    factors have two conditions, while Barrier has three (i.e., no barrier, or one
    of two barrier types). A reduced factorial design utilizing 20 different material
    combinations is used along with a minimum of two repeats for each combination.
    The experimental behaviors of interest are flame spread (characterized by time-resolved
    flame edge contours on the back and seat cushions) and fire growth (characterized
    by heat release rate measurements). A variety of parameters are used to characterize
    the temporal variations of both. Graphical representations of the results suggest
    that three of the factors (Barrier, Foam, and Fabric) have easily identified effects
    on mock-up burning behavior. This finding is confirmed by a variety of analyses
    showing these three factors have statistically significant effects on mock-up
    burning behaviors, with Barrier and Fabric having strong and roughly equal effects
    and Foam somewhat weaker effects. Changes in Fiber Wrap or Thread result in no
    statistically significant effects on the parameters. It is also shown that interactions
    between Barrier and Foam are statistically significant and will need to be considered
    in approaches designed to predict burning behavior. In addition to characterization
    of flame spread and fire growth, supplementary measurements of mass and radiative
    heat flux at six locations around the mock-ups provide additional insights concerning
    mock-up burning behavior. The real-scale results are compared to previous studies
    to provide additional understanding of RUF burning. and its dependence on material
    properties.
