abstract:
- content: 'This report documents performance of face recognition algorithms submitted
    for evaluation on image datasets maintained at NIST. The algorithms implement
    one-to-many identification of faces appearing in two-dimensional images. The primary
    dataset is comprised of 26.6 million reasonably well-controlled live portrait
    photos of 12.3 million individuals. Three smaller datasets containing more unconstrained
    photos are also used: 3.2 million webcam images; 2.5 million photojournalism and
    amateur photographer photos; and 90 thousand faces cropped from surveillance-style
    video clips. The report will be useful for comparison of face recognition algorithms,
    and assessment of absolute capability.'
