abstract:
- content: HAMQAP was launched in collaboration with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements
    (ODS) in 2017. HAMQAP was established to enable laboratories to improve the accuracy
    of measurements in samples that represent human intake (e.g., foods, dietary supplements,
    tobacco) and samples that represent human metabolism (e.g., blood, serum, plasma,
    urine) for demonstration of proficiency and/or compliance with various regulations.
    Analytes are paired where possible to represent the full spectrum of health assessment.
    Exercise 5 of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories to assess
    their in house measurements of nutritional elements (calcium, iron, potassium,
    and sodium), contaminants (arsenic and arsenic species, chlorate and perchlorate),
    water-soluble vitamins (several B vitamins), fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin D and
    metabolites), fatty acids (select omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids), botanicals
    (catechins), natural products (xanthines), and proximates in foods and dietary
    supplements, and corresponding biomarkers/metabolites in clinical specimens (human
    red blood cells, sera, and urine).
