abstract:
- content: SP 800-73-2 specifies the PIV data model, Application Programming Interface
    (API) and card interface requirements necessary to comply with the use cases,
    as defined in Section 6 of FIPS 201 and further described in this document. Interoperability
    is defined as the use of PIV identity credentials such that client-application
    programs, compliant card applications, and compliant integrated circuits cards
    (ICC) can be used interchangeably by all information processing systems across
    Federal agencies. SP 800-73-2 defines the PIV data elements identifiers, structure
    and format. SP 800-73-2 also describes the client application programming interface
    and card command interface for use of the PIV Card.
