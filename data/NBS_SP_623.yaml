abstract:
- content: Throughout the United States, increasing concern is being expressed for
    the need to more fully utilize the existing building stock. The report documents
    a process that was initiated in late 1977 and continues to the present time in
    which particular regulatory problems impacting building rehabilitation were identified,
    a regulatory concept which responded to these problems was formulated, and the
    actual implementation of the new approach in the State of Massachusetts. Article
    22 of the Massachusetts State Building Code is printed in the Appendix of the
    report and four case studies of actual buildings which were rehabilitated are
    included.
