abstract:
- content: 'This report describes the test methodology from LTE impacts on GPS: Test
    and Metrology Plan developed by National Advanced Spectrum and Communications
    Test Network (NASCTN), and data that are the result of executing the test method.
    The fundamental goals in developing the test plan development were: a transparent,
    reproducible, and well-calibrated test method, sound and statistically- valid
    data retrieval and processing methods, a clear path from measurement setup to
    data collection to processed results, and data to inform discussions between different
    interests on proper measurement requirements. The NASCTN team performed radiated
    testing to execute the test plan. These efforts amount to a test campaign intended
    to refine the test method and publish data for the stakeholder community. To this
    end, the team set out to: provide data of sufficient quality and relevance to
    support sound decision-making, articulate the importance of measurement uncertainty
    along with its relationship with the design and execution of the test method,
    and convey key implementation details that to support future execution of the
    test method.'
