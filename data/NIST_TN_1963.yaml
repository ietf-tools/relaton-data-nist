abstract:
- content: While the influence of paste properties on concrete performance has been
    extensively studied and in many cases reduced to quantitative relationships, that
    between aggregate characteristics and concrete performance has not been investigated
    in detail. Based on previous research that demonstrated significant strength differences
    for two similar concrete mixtures, one prepared with limestone aggregates and
    the other with siliceous gravel, a joint study between the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology and the Federal Highway Administration was initiated
    to explore in detail the influence of aggregate characteristics on concrete performance.
    Eleven aggregates of differing mineralogy were identified and obtained both for
    bulk characterization and for incorporation into two concrete mixtures. The first
    concrete mixture was based on a 100 % ordinary Type I/II portland cement (OPC),
    while the second consisted of a ternary 60:30:10 volumetric blend of this cement
    with 30 % of a Class C fly ash and 10 % of a fine limestone powder. This latter
    sustainable mixture had exhibited exemplary performance in a previous study. Aggregates
    were characterized with respect to mechanical and thermomechanical properties,
    geometrical characteristics, and surface energies. For the prepared concretes,
    mechanical, thermomechanical, and electrical properties were measured at ages
    to 91 d and microstructural examinations were conducted to examine the interfaces
    between aggregates and cement paste. Concrete performance varied widely amongst
    the different aggregates, with the range/average value for 28-d compressive strength
    being 32?% for the OPC concretes and 37 % for those based on the ternary blend
    binder. With the exceptions of relating concrete modulus to aggregate modulus
    and concrete coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to aggregate CTE, weak correlations
    were generally obtained between a single aggregate characteristic and concrete
    performance properties.
