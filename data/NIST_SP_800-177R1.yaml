abstract:
- content: This document gives recommendations and guidelines for enhancing trust
    in email. Thee primary audience for these recommendations is federal enterprise
    email administrators, information security specialists and network managers. While
    some of the guidelines in this document pertain to federal IT systems and network
    policy, most of the document will be more general in nature and could apply to
    any organization. For most of this document, it will be assumed that the organization
    has some or all responsibility for email and can configure or manage its own email
    and Domain Name System (DNS) systems. Even if this is not the case, the guidelines
    and recommendations in this document may help in education about email security
    and can be used to produce a set of requirements for a contracted service.
