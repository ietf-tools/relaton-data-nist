abstract:
- content: This report documents the results of a series of comparative analyses which
    were conducted on the Charpy machines located at NIST in Boulder, Colorado. The
    analyses were performed both on historical data, collected over a period of more
    than 20 years, and newly obtained test results from almost 300 instrumented and
    non-instrumented impact tests on verification specimens of low energy (13 J to
    20 J), high energy (88 J to 136 J), and super-high energy (176 J to 244 J). The
    comparative analyses were completed for the purpose of understanding the limits
    of calibrating instrumented strikers for use in dynamic test through conventional
    static calibration procedures. Test results, obtained both in the past and within
    the current study, show that one of the so-called master machines (used to establish
    reference values for ASTM verification specimens) delivers consistently lower
    energy values than the other two master machines in the 15 J - 20 J range. This
    is suspected to be due to its higher stiffness and hammer design (C-type), which
    increases its natural frequency of vibration and causes early fracture in a quasi-brittle
    (low-energy) test. The extremely large number of instrumented Charpy tests performed
    within this investigation (more than 200) allowed us to assess the reliability
    of the conventional static calibration procedure for our instrumented strikers,
    as compared to different approaches for the adjustment/correction of measured
    force values. Even though these approaches were found beneficial in improving
    the between-machine consistency, statistically significant differences remained
    nonetheless. It appears that, in order to reliably calibrate an instrumented striker,
    forces must be applied at loading rates that are equivalent to those encountered
    during actual tests (dynamic calibration of instrumented strikers). This should
    become a clear objective of the NIST Charpy program going forward.
