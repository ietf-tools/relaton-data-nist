abstract:
- content: Recent development of accurate instruments for measuring greenhouse gas
    concentrations and the ability to mount them in ground-based vehicles has provided
    an opportunity to make temporally and spatially resolved measurements in the vicinity
    of suspected source locations, and for subsequently estimating the source location
    and strength. The basic approach of using downwind atmospheric measurements in
    an inversion methodology to predict the source strength and location is an ill-posed
    problem and results in large uncertainty. In this report, we present a new measurement
    methodology for reducing the uncertainty in predicting source strength from downwind
    measurements associated with inverse modeling. In order to demonstrate the approach,
    an inversion methodology built around a plume dispersion model is developed. Synthetic
    data derived from an assumed source distribution is used to compare and contrast
    the predicted source strength and location. The effect of introducing various
    levels of noise in the synthetic data or uncertainty in meteorological variables
    on the inversion methodology is studied. Results indicate that the use of noisy
    measurement data had a small effect on the total predicted source strength, but
    gave rise to several spurious sources (in many cases 8-10 sources were detected,
    while the assumed source distribution only consisted of 2 sources). Use of noisy
    measurement data for inversion also introduced large uncertainty in the location
    of the predicted sources. A mathematical model for estimating an upper bound on
    the uncertainty, and a bootstrap statistical approach for determining the variability
    in the predicted source distribution is demonstrated. The new measurement methodology,
    which involves using measurement data from two or more wind directions, combined
    together as part of a single inversion process is presented. Results of the bootstrap
    process indicated that the uncertainty in locating sources reduced significantly
    when measurements are made using the new proposed measurement approach. The proposed
    measurement system can be significant in determining emission inventories in urban
    domains at a high level of reliability, and for studying the role of remediation
    measures.
