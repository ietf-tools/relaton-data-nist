abstract:
- content: The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the default routing protocol to route
    traffic among internet domains. While BGP performs adequately in identifying viable
    paths that reflect local routing policies and preferences to destinations, the
    lack of built-in security allows the protocol to be exploited by route hijacking.
    Route hijacking occurs when an entity accidentally or maliciously alters an intended
    route. Such attacks can (1) deny access to internet services, (2) detour internet
    traffic to permit eavesdropping and to facilitate on-path attacks on end points
    (sites), (3) misdeliver internet network traffic to malicious end points, (4)
    undermine internet protocol (IP) address-based reputation and filtering systems,
    and (5) cause routing instability in the internet. This document describes a security
    platform that demonstrates how to improve the security of inter-domain routing
    traffic exchange. The platform provides route origin validation (ROV) by using
    the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) in a manner that mitigates some
    misconfigurations and malicious attacks associated with route hijacking. The example
    solutions and architectures presented here are based upon standards-based, open-source,
    and commercially available products.
