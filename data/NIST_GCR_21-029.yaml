abstract:
- content: 'In 2019, COACh, an organization dedicated to developing equitable opportunities
    in science and engineering, contracted with NIST to design and implement a data-driven
    study to examine the causes of inequity in promotions and develop draft recommendations.
    This document compiles reports of that work. A companion report by Maya Noviski,
    NIST GCR 21-030 Supporting Women and Under-Represented Minorities in the Sciences:
    Implementing Equitable Approaches to organizational Change summarizes scholarly
    literature that informed final recommendations. The work began with listening
    sessions with NIST scientific staff and administrators (mainly ZPs and ZTs), which
    revealed that many employees held strong views about promotion opportunities and
    process. This was followed by analyses of NIST personnel actions from 2000 to
    2019. (Reports in Part I.) In contrast to views often expressed in the listening
    sessions and implicit in the wording of the call for proposals, extensive statistical
    analyses found little evidence that women were disadvantaged in promotions or
    salaries. A survey of ZP employees supported these conclusions. (Reports in Part
    II.) However, extensive statistical analyses and examination of open-ended comments
    indicated less than half of the employees believed that the promotion criteria
    were understood by employees or appropriate for the NIST mission or their unit
    or that the promotion process was fair. The concerns were more often expressed
    by those at lower pay bands. Within bands, gender differences in views were minimal.
    Focus groups with ZP staff and Group Leaders, as well as interviews with ZT staff,
    confirmed the conclusions from the HR data and survey and provided examples of
    issues with the promotion criteria and process. Direct quotes informed our conclusions
    and expanded our recommendations for change. (Reports in part III.) The recommendations
    are designed to help develop a more transparent promotion process that is seen
    as fair and equitable by all staff (Part IV). Appendices include material for
    leaders implementing change or those interested in replicating the work.'
