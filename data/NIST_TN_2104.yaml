- content: This report describes the design of a direct-contact heat exchanger (DCHEX)
    to be used for thermal energy storage at the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology s Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF). The heat exchanger
    was designed for heat exchange between a phase-change material (PCM) and refrigerant.
    The design required the selection of a PCM that would be immiscible with the refrigerant
    and have a freezing point temperature of approximately of 285 K. A key facet of
    the investigation was the construction of a test apparatus to observe the flow
    between the refrigerant and the freezing PCM to ensure a well distributed flow
    and one where the refrigerant could flow past the frozen PCM. The final part of
    the project presents a design for direct-contact heat exchange between octanoic
    acid (continuous phase) and the dispersed phase R410A. Twin DCHEXs were designed
    to house a vertical column of PCM and to distribute the refrigerant flow throughout
    the PCM. The height of the PCM column was determined with measurements from the
    literature that were re-correlated to predict the droplet heat transfer coefficient
    and the required height of the PCM column. A disengagement section was designed
    to prevent entrainment of PCM droplets into the exiting refrigerant vapor during
    the PCM charging. Basic equations are provided so that the design may be modified
    for a different PCM mass, refrigerant flow rate, temperature difference and operating
    fluids. An overall drawing of the DCHEX with placement of orifice holes, mist
    eliminator, and piping was given. The energy storage capacity of the DCHEX is
    approximately 191 MJ and has the potential of providing a 33 % energy savings
    in cooling the NZERTF.
