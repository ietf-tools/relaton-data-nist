abstract:
- content: This Guide Brief focuses on assisting communities with Step 2, Understand
    the Situation, with respect to communication systems. When characterizing communication
    systems in a community, communities need to gain an understanding of both service
    provider systems and their own systems. In some situations, communities may need
    to leverage communication service provider systems and their capabilities. In
    other cases, communities may have the capability to provide their own recovery
    resources. The primary intended audience for this Guide Brief is the portion of
    the collaborative planning team focused on understanding and improving recovery
    of communication systems.
