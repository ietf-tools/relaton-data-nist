abstract:
- content: This handbook has been prepared as a procedural guide for the compliance
    testing of net contents statements on packaged goods. Compliance testing of packaged
    goods is the determination of the conformance results of the packaging, distribution,
    and retailing process (the packages) to specific legal requirements for net content
    declarations. This handbook has been developed primarily for the use of government
    officials; however, it should also be useful to commercial and industrial establishments
    in the areas of packaging, distribution, and sale of commodities. In conducting
    compliance testing, the conversion of quantity values from one measuring system
    to another (e.g., from the metric system to the avoirdupois system) should be
    handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between accuracy of
    the data and the number of digits displayed. In all conversion, the number of
    significant digits retained should ensure that accuracy is neither sacrificed
    nor exaggerated. For this edition of Handbook 133, all dimensions for test procedures,
    devices, or environments have been rounded to two significant digits (e.g., 2.5
    cm to 1.0 in) or to a precision level applicable to the test equipment (e.g.,
    200 kPa for 25 psi and 35 MPs for 5000 psi).
