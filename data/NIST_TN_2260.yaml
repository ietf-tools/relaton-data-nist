abstract:
- content: 'Textiles used in the construction of structural firefighter turnout gear
    jackets and pants have been found to contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
    (PFAS) as well as fluoropolymer membranes and treatments containing fluorinated
    polymers. Additionally, older and used turnout gear have been found to contain
    greater concentrations of PFAS compared with new gear, though the source of these
    elevated PFAS concentrations is still under investigation. To determine if the
    stressing turnout gear textiles encounter during typical use could contribute
    to the observation of higher PFAS concentrations, this Technical Note reports
    the concentrations of 51 PFAS in 20 firefighter turnout gear textiles following
    exposure to abrasion, elevated temperatures, laundering, or weathering by exposure
    to ultraviolet radiation and elevated humidity. Compared with corresponding concentrations
    in unstressed textiles, individual and summed PFAS concentrations were higher
    following exposure to abrasion, elevated temperature, and weathering, but were
    similar or slightly lower following laundering. For example, the median summed
    PFAS concentrations among durable water repellent treated outer shell textiles
    rose from 1,430 µg/kg when new to 3,500 µg/kg with abrasion, 4,420 µg/kg with
    exposure to elevated temperatures, and 3,540 µg/kg with weathering, while it fell
    to 963 µg/kg with laundering. These changes in summed PFAS concentrations with
    stressing largely reflected changes in the concentrations of PFAS that were present
    in the highest concentration in unstressed turnout gear textiles: 6:2 FTMAC and
    6:2 FTOH. Consequently, while physical stressing may contribute to altered PFAS
    concentrations in stressed compared with unstressed turnout gear textiles, the
    mechanisms responsible for these changes cannot be authoritatively identified
    by the targeted analytical approach employed here. For example, the analytical
    approached used in this report cannot distinguish between PFAS production by the
    chemical transformation of PFAS that were excluded from the targeted analyte list
    from enhanced PFAS extraction due to degradation of firefighter gear textiles
    and their associated fluorinated polymer treatments.'
