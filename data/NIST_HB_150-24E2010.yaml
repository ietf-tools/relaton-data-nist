abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 150-24 presents technical requirements and guidance for the
    accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
    Program (NVLAP) Personal Body Armor program. It is intended for information and
    use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation, laboratory
    accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing information
    on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2009 edition of
    NIST Handbook 150-24 incorporates changes resulting from the release of the newest
    editions of ISO/IEC 17025, General requirements for the competence of testing
    and calibration laboratories, and NIST Handbook 150, NVLAP Procedures and General
    Requirements, as well as editorial improvements. The requirements of NIST Handbook
    150, the interpretations and specific requirements in NIST Handbook 150-24, and
    the requirements in program-specific checklists (if applicable) must be combined
    to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP Personal Body Armor program.
