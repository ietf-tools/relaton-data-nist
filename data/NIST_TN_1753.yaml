abstract:
- content: This report summarizes the presentations, discussions and recommendations
    of a workshop held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in December
    of 2011. The purpose of the workshop was to identify challenges, research, and
    implementation issues in product design, manufacturing, and quality assurance
    where a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as the authoritative
    information source for all activities in the product's lifecycle. The report includes
    an overview of model-based engineering and its technical challenges, summaries
    of the presentations given at the workshop, and conclusions that emerged from
    the presentations and discussions.
