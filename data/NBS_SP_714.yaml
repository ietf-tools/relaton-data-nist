abstract:
- content: The directory presents information on 61 U.S. Government certification
    programs for products and services. Entries describe the scope and nature of each
    certification program, testing and inspection practices, standards used, methods
    of identification and enforcement, reciprocal recognition or acceptance of certification,
    and other relevant details. The directory is part of an ongoing NBS effort to
    establish and maintain a comprehensive database on standards, regulations, certification
    programs and related information. The material has been compiled to meet the needs
    of government, industry, and the public for information on U.S. Government certification
    programs in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Trade Agreements Act
    of 1979.
