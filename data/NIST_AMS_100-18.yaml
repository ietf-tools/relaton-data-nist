abstract:
- content: 'The manufacturing atmosphere is continually changing with new technologies
    and standards being swiftly developed. Firms create competitive advantages using
    their knowledge, skills, supply chains, and processes to create superior products
    at lower prices. In such a competitive environment, efficient machinery maintenance
    methods can mean the difference between a thriving profitable firm and one that
    loses money and sales. Currently, at the national level there is limited understanding
    of the costs and losses associated with machinery maintenance or the different
    machinery maintenance techniques. This report examines the literature and data
    available for estimating the costs and losses relevant to different manufacturing
    maintenance techniques. It extends further to identify the data needed for making
    such estimates and the feasibility of collecting the relevant data. This report
    focuses on, but is not limited to, four categories of manufacturing: machinery,
    computer and electronic products, electrical equipment, and transportation equipment
    manufacturers.'
