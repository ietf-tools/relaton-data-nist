abstract:
- content: This report presents a state-of-the-art review of the measurement of pressure
    loss of pipe fittings. The mechanisms of pressure loss in pipes and fittings are
    discussed to facilitate the understanding of this these measurement and their
    challenges problem. Existing methods for measuring the pressure loss of pipe fittings
    are critically reviewed. Advantages and disadvantages of each method and other
    general considerations are discussed. The instrumentation techniques are illustrated
    in detail, including guidelines and considerations for the design or selection
    of pressure taps, impulse lines, pressure transducers, and flow meters. The available
    pressure loss data of pipe fittings, published from 1926 to 2019, are reviewed.
    In general, most of the existing data are not representative of modern pipe fittings
    and flow conditions. Future research efforts are described to focus on developing
    a standard method of test and terminology, and generating new representative data
    for modern pipe fittings.
