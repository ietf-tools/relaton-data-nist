abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance on how an organization, through the use
    of metrics, identifies the adequacy of in-place security controls, policies, and
    procedures. It provides an approach to help management decide where to invest
    in additional security protection resources or identify and evaluate nonproductive
    controls. It explains the metric development and implementation process and how
    it can also be used to adequately justify security control investments. The results
    of an effective metric program can provide useful data for directing the allocation
    of information security resources and should simplify the preparation of performance-related
    reports.
