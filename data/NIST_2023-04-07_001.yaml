abstract:
- content: In response to the work-related fatality at the National Fire Research
    Laboratory on September 26, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) initiated a planned, two-step process to understand the causes of the incident
    and identify actions necessary to prevent future incidents. Incident investigation
    and development of an incident corrective action plan. The investigation was conducted
    by staff from the NIST Office of Safety, Health, and Environment and the NIST
    Engineering Laboratory. The focus was on identifying the causal factors, root
    causes, and contributing factors of the specific incident. Corrective actions
    were developed to address the deficiencies identified, as well as other recommendations
    for NIST leadership to consider. The results of this effort are presented in Part
    A of this document. Executive Team review and development of a NIST-level corrective
    action plan. Subsequently, a subcommittee of NISTâ€™s Executive Safety Committee
    assessed the report and considered the NIST-wide applicability of the corrective
    actions identified. The Executive Review Team extended corrective actions and
    recommendations, as necessary, to ensure sufficient breadth, depth, and sustainability
    of these actions across NIST. Their work is included in Part B of this report.
    Through these two activities, NIST shall strengthen its safety management system
    and address existing shortcomings in its safety culture to protect the safety
    and health of all staff.
