abstract:
- content: A security configuration checklist is a document that contains instructions
    or procedures for configuring an information technology (IT) product to an operational
    environment, for verifying that the product has been configured properly, and/or
    for identifying unauthorized changes to the product. Using these checklists can
    minimize the attack surface, reduce vulnerabilities, lessen the impact of successful
    attacks, and identify changes that might otherwise go undetected. To facilitate
    development of checklists and to make checklists more organized and usable, NIST
    established the National Checklist Program (NCP). This publication explains how
    to use the NCP to find and retrieve checklists, and it also describes the policies,
    procedures, and general requirements for participation in the NCP.
