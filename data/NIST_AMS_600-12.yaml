abstract:
- content: This document provides an overview of the stakeholder responses, consensus
    and an overarching summary of some of the thematic areas that emerged from the
    Request for Information (RFI). NIST's approach to summarizing the comments received
    in the RFI was to capture the range and breadth of public input, including common
    themes and points of divergence. NIST appreciates the richness of the input received
    from and recognizes that detailed specific comments may not be included in this
    summary. Readers who would like to see the comments in their entirety can find
    those at regulations.gov. The RFI analysis and high-level summary was performed
    by the NIST team by categorizing responses by the five RFI topic areas, individual
    questions and corresponding responses when applicable, and respondent and organization
    type. Where applicable, the NIST team also appropriately mapped comments from
    the text of the general responses to specific RFI questions. Where applicable,
    specific suggestions from the responses were reproduced as part of the high-level
    summary.
