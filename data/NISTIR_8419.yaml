abstract:
- content: As supply chains become more complex and the origins of products become
    harder to discern, efforts are emerging that improve traceability of goods by
    exchanging traceability data records using blockchain and related technologies.
    This NIST NCCoE publication explores the issues that surround traceability, the
    role that blockchain and related technologies may be able to play to improve traceability,
    and several case studies in use today.
