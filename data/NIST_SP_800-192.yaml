abstract:
- content: Access control systems are among the most critical of computer security
    components. Faulty policies, misconfigurations, or flaws in software implementations
    can result in serious vulnerabilities. To formally and precisely capture the security
    properties that access control should adhere to, access control models are usually
    written, bridging the gap in abstraction between policies and mechanisms. Identifying
    discrepancies between policy specifications and their intended function is crucial
    because correct implementation and enforcement of policies by applications is
    based on the premise that the policy specifications are correct. As a result,
    policy specifications represented by models must undergo rigorous verification
    and validation through systematic verification and testing to ensure that the
    policy specifications truly encapsulate the desires of the policy authors. Verifying
    the conformance of access control policies and models is a non-trivial and critical
    task, and one important aspect of such verification is to formally check the inconsistency
    and incompleteness of the model and safety requirements of the policy, because
    an access control model and its implementation do not necessarily explicitly express
    the policy, which can also be implicitly embedded by mixing with direct access
    constraints or other access control models.
