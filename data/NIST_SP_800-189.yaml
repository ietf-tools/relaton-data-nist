abstract:
- content: In recent years, numerous routing control plane anomalies, such as Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP) prefix hijacking and route leaks, have resulted in denial-of-service
    (DoS), unwanted data traffic detours, and performance degradation. Large-scale
    distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on servers using spoofed internet
    protocol (IP) addresses and reflection-amplification in the data plane have also
    been frequent, resulting in significant disruption of services and damages. This
    special publication on Resilient Interdomain Traffic Exchange (RITE) includes
    initial guidance on securing the interdomain routing control traffic, preventing
    IP address spoofing, and certain aspects of DoS/DDoS detection and mitigation.
    Many of the recommendations in this publication focus on the Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP). BGP is the control protocol used to distribute and compute paths between
    the tens of thousands of autonomous networks that comprise the internet. Technologies
    recommended in this document for securing the interdomain routing control traffic
    include Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), BGP origin validation (BGP-OV),
    and prefix filtering. Additionally, technologies recommended for mitigating DoS/DDoS
    attacks focus on prevention of IP address spoofing using source address validation
    (SAV) with access control lists (ACLs) and unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF).
    Other technologies (including some application plane methods) such as remotely
    triggered black hole (RTBH) filtering, flow specification (Flowspec), and response
    rate limiting (RRL) are also recommended as part of the overall security mechanisms.
