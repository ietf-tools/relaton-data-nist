abstract:
- content: The gut microbiome plays a critical role in a vast and disparate set of
    health and disease states, including cancer and obesity. Human fecal is a complex
    mixture including microbes, proteins, undigested plant matter and fat content
    according to the diet type (e.g., vegan, omnivore). The complexity of human fecal
    material along with the complexity of the analytical workflow of omics-based techniques
    makes metabolomics measurements challenging. To address this need, NIST is developing
    a human stool reference material (RM) to compare and assess reproducibility in
    omics-based techniques. This report shares the initial characterization of a human
    stool research grade testing material (RGTM). At NIST, a RGTM is an exploratory
    material developed to evaluate fit-for-purpose needs within a community. This
    effort started in 2019 and since then, the manufacturer for the material has changed
    and protocols to analyze the samples have been optimized. The approaches used
    to characterize the samples described in this report may or may not be the current
    approach used on the development of RM 8048. In addition, it should be stated
    the material used in the RGTM and consequently in the RM is not an authentic representation
    of human stool as it was pre-processed (homogenized, diluted in water and bottled)
    after collection for research application.
