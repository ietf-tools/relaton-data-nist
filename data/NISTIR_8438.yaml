abstract:
- content: In FY 2021, the 22 federal agencies that reported did not add or rescind
    any GUS in lieu of VCS, therefore there remains a total of 80 previously reported
    GUS in lieu of VCS still in use. This analysis does not reflect the use of standards
    by the Department of Defense (DoD) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) as they report their use of GUS on a categorical basis via a different
    reporting mechanism. Agencies demonstrate the effectiveness of the NTTAA and Circular
    A-119 by their continuous review of opportunities to rescind GUS in favor of using
    VCS, and their involvement with the private sector through the VCS process. These
    activities suggest that federal agencies are cognizant of the benefits of meeting
    their mission needs by actively seeking to use VCS developed by the private sector.
    In accordance with its coordination role as defined in the NTTAA and OMB A-119,
    NIST continues to assist federal agencies and their stakeholders with standards
    and conformity assessment information, program support, guidance, and policy concerns.
    NIST hosts http://standards.gov, which offers ongoing practical guidance and information
    needed by agencies to implement the NTTAA successfully and report standards activities
    as required by the NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119. This report fulfills the annual
    reporting requirements of both the NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119.
