abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the Time
    Distribution Alternatives for the Smart Grid Workshop at its Gaithersburg, Maryland
    Campus on March 21, 2017. The event, co-hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy,
    brought together experts from industry, government, national laboratories, and
    academia to determine research and development (R&D) priorities for alternatives
    to global positioning system (GPS) time distribution in electrical power systems.
    The information gained will inform future NIST, DOE, national laboratories and
    private sector technical programs and strategic planning. The workshop also served
    to drive discussion for the North American Synchrophasor Initiative (NASPI) working
    group meeting held following the workshop.
