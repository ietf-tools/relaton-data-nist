abstract:
- content: The intention of this dictionary is to define relevant terms and metrics
    used in the characterization of single-photon detectors and sources with the goal
    to promote better understanding and communication of those metrics across the
    single-photon technology community. With the recent emergence and significant
    growth of a “quantum-component industry,” the need for common definitions of terms
    is clear and pressing. For example, a recent workshop sponsored by the Quantum
    Economic Development Consortium [QC23] identified the need for a common set of
    definitions for single-photon device performance metrics [QED23]. There are some
    existing documents relevant to this need, but they are focused on somewhat different
    purposes or on one specific application. For example, the ETSI document [LL09,
    ETS18] focuses specifically on the application of quantum key distribution, and
    there is a vocabulary resource under the auspices of the CIE (International Commission
    on Illumination). That CIE resource [CIE20] is focused on the illumination industry.
    For completeness we also mention several publications which contain some compendiums
    of single photon definitions [EFMP11, MPFB13a, MSSM20]. Our effort here is intended
    to compliment and build on those existing reference documents, to create a dictionary
    independent of a particular single-photon application (for long-term relevance)
    and to promote clarity and understanding when terms and metrics relevant to single-photon
    sources or detectors are used by the community. This document also seeks to dispel
    common misconceptions and to make a few subtle distinctions that will benefit
    the community. This document may form the basis for a future standards document.
    With that as a goal, we facilitated a thorough peer-review by fellow National
    Institute of Standards and Technologies colleagues, the Quantum Economic Development
    Consortium, representatives of other National Metrology Institutes, and the larger
    single-photon community. We hope that this document will promote a community-wide
    consensus on the definitions herein and help facilitate the growth of the single
    photon industry.
