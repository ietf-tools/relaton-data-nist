abstract:
- content: The recent release of Building Industry Reporting and Design for Sustainability
    (BIRDS) v3.0 incorporated the energy, environmental, and cost measurements for
    240 000 residential building designs for a 2-story colonial house based on the
    NIST Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF) located in Gaithersburg,
    MD for study period lengths ranging from 1 year to 40 years. Focusing on a single
    location allows for consideration of incremental building energy efficiency improvements
    instead of the suite of energy efficiency requirements specified in the International
    Energy Conservation Code (IECC) as was the focus of the residential database incorporated
    in BIRDS v2.0. Building design specifications included in the database span the
    five most recent IECC editions through net-zero energy performance. Additional
    options not included in previous versions of BIRDS are input alternatives for
    discount rate, home loan financing, and construction quality for a total of 8
    cases. The 240 000 designs across 8 cases (sets of assumptions) and 40 study periods
    allows for comparisons across over 75 million records to determine the effects
    of improving building energy efficiency on the overall sustainability performance.
    The purpose of this study is to utilize similar methodology as that used in prior
    analysis of BIRDS databases to analyze the BIRDS low-energy residential database.
    Our analysis will entail making comparisons between a Maryland residential code-compliant
    design (based on 2015 IECC), serving as our baseline, and a series of alternative
    designs with varying levels of energy efficiency based on energy, economic, and
    environmental performance. Findings from this study will shed light on the effects
    of incremental improvements in residential building energy efficiency, as well
    as the effects of varying the investor s time horizon and other assumptions, on
    overall sustainability performance in terms of energy efficiency, life-cycle assessment
    score coupled with life-cycle cost considerations.
