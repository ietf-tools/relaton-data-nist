abstract:
- content: Once a law has been enacted by Congress, the appropriate federal agency
    (e.g., the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the
    National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, et al.) may create the regulations
    to implement the law. Before such regulations can be adopted, the appropriate
    federal agency ordinarily will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to
    solicit public comments on the proposed rules. To provide opportunity for public
    comment, the appropriate federal agency must issue draft regulations or Proposed
    Rules that are published in the Federal Register and as a WTO TBT notification.
    The agency reviews the comments and can then issue a Final Rule that also is published
    in the Federal Register, and later, published annually in the Code of Federal
    Regulations (CFR). Together, the enabling acts and laws [published in the United
    States Code (USC) once passed] and the final regulations (published in the CFR)
    provide a framework for the implementation and enforcement of most federal laws
    in the United States.
