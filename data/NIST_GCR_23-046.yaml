abstract:
- content: Designed around Industry 4.0 based digital technology, flexible manufacturing
    cells are envisioned to comprise a variety of machines capable of peer-to-peer
    communication, learning, and adaptation with the end goal of creating a standards-based,
    brand-agnostic, autonomously managed work cell free of any human influence. In
    this project, CCAM developed a physical and digital flexible manufacturing cell
    built primarily on open standards and open-source technologies to address the
    opportunities and challenges of development of a strong communication framework,
    as well as the semantics and context to drive individual decision making down
    to the machine or controller and enable brand-agnostic interoperability. This
    reference implementation of a full digital and flexible manufacturing cell can
    be used for the further development of standards and technologies surrounding
    the digital thread and distributed manufacturing.
