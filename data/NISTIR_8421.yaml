abstract:
- content: NIST has developed a user-friendly spreadsheet-based software for the analysis
    of elastic-plastic fracture toughness tests conducted according to ASTM E1820-20b
    on either Compact Tension or Single-Edge Bend specimens using the Unloading/Elastic
    Compliance (UC/EC) single-specimen technique. The software consists of multiple
    spreadsheets, which feature several macros that automatize most calculations.
    Complete user's instructions are provided in this report. The software has been
    successfully validated using nine sample data sets that are available through
    ASTM, covering both specimen configurations and various fracture toughness levels.
    As in the case of previous software packages developed by the Fatigue and Fracture
    Group of NIST Boulder, the spreadsheet will be made freely available to the public
    by contacting the author of this report.
