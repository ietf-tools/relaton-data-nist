abstract:
- content: Wireless connections are becoming popular in industrial environments that
    increasingly carry sensing and actuation data over the air. In industrial plants,
    activities of legacy wireless systems have shaped the channel usage in the radio
    spectrum bands for new wireless applications. The 2 GHz spectrum band consists
    of a good number of radio resources that are dedicated to fixed and mobile wireless
    communications. In this report, passive measurement data collected in two industrial
    plants is analyzed to identify existing wireless activities in this frequency
    band. Besides, a statistical channel usage model is developed for the 2.4 GHz
    Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. The secondary spectrum utility
    is evaluated given legacy wireless activity in the ISM band, which is of particular
    interest to unlicensed industrial wireless networking standards, such as WirelessHART
    and ISA100.11a.
