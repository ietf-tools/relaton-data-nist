abstract:
- content: Spray polyurethane foam (SPF) insulation increases building energy efficiency
    by reducing conductive and convective heat losses through the building envelope
    and is used in both new construction and retrofit applications. Health complaints
    relating to emissions from SPF installations have spurred a joint industry and
    federal effort to develop standard methods to quantify airborne emissions from
    SPF. As part of this effort, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) tasked
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with developing testing
    and measurement protocols to determine the quantities and properties of compounds
    released from SPF, such as amine catalysts and aldehydes, as it is applied in
    residential settings. Specifically, this effort examined if micro-chamber emission
    results can be used to determine concentrations in indoor environments and to
    quantify the emissions from a SPF sample that was applied in a potentially non-ideal
    manner. The data demonstrate that emissions from SPF are chemical, temperature,
    flow, and foam type dependent. Micro-chamber data can be used to compare chemical
    emission profiles from various foams, but micro-chamber emission rates for flame
    retardants cannot be directly applied to full scale emissions in a building. The
    results from examining SPF in a residential test home suggest that occupants may
    be exposed to measureable concentrations of the flame retardant tris (1-chloro-2-propyl)
    phosphate (TCPP) two years after application of open cell foam. CPSC submitted
    a SPF sample suggestive of being applied in a non-ideal manner. When the submitted
    SPF was tested in the micro-chamber, over 17 different chemicals were identified
    with a spectrum match, seven of which had not been previously identified in literature
    emitting from other foams. Of the chemicals for which concentrations were quantified
    in the micro-chamber experiments, triethylenediamine concentrations were the highest.
    The emission rates of six chemicals were quantified from the SPF. The emission
    rates of all chemicals except for TCPP decreased in a negative exponential manner.
    More information on chemicals emitted from SPF in buildings are needed to determine
    if the tested foam is indeed a misapplied foam. Emission rates in this document
    apply only to micro-chamber conditions. This data should not be used to predict
    full-scale emissions until further testing has determined mass transfer parameters.
