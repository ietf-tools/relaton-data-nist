abstract:
- content: Computer viruses continue to pose a threat to the integrity and availability
    of computer systems. This is especially true for users of personal computers.
    A variety of anti-virus tools are now available to help manage this threat. These
    tools use a wide range of techniques to detect, identify, and remove viruses.
    This guide provides criteria for judging the functionality, practicality, and
    convenience of anti-virus tools. It furnishes information which readers can use
    to determine which tools are best suited to target environments, but it does not
    weigh the merits of specific tools.
