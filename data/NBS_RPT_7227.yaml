abstract:
- content: Modifications in siting criteria are suggested for the VHF Omni-Directional
    Range navigation aid. Specifically, changes of transmitting antenna height and
    vertical pattern shape which would decrease undesired ground reflections and increase
    the range of service are proposed. A short discussion of azimuth errors due to
    undesired reflections is presented. A method of optimizing the angle of tilt for
    a given vertical pattern and antenna height is presented. Finally, the results
    of calculated expected coverage patterns for two tilted arrays and a typical VOR
    transmitting antenna are compared.
