abstract:
- content: This report sets out to answer three questions. What effect does installing
    smoke detectors have on reported fires and casualties for the average household?
    How much of an effect would increasing smoke detector utilization have on the
    total number of fires and casualties in the United States? And what are the attributes
    of homes currently without smoke detectors and where are they located? We estimate
    the installation of smoke detectors in homes without them reduces the expected
    number of fires reported from a (formerly) non-smoke-detector residence by a factor
    of 3.5 to 5, and reduces the number of expected casualties by a factor of 2.5
    to 3.5. Unexpectedly, we find the number of casualties per reported fire is lower
    for non-smoke- detector households compared to smoke-detector households. This
    could be due to changes in people's behavior when they have a smoke detector in
    the house or because the less dangerous fires are preferentially extinguished
    when smoke detectors are present. If smoke detectors were installed in all residences,
    the number of fires reported to the fire department could be reduced by 25 % or
    more. More realistically, each percent increase in smoke detector penetration
    reduces reported fires by more than 2.6 %. Finally, estimates of smoke detector
    utilization at the census tract level were developed for the entire country. We
    find evidence that the number of homes with smoke detectors are lower than current
    estimates that rely on telephone-only survey interviews. We estimate actual smoke
    detector usage is likely below 92 %. It seems likely that this is due to a correlation
    between phone presence and smoke detector utilization.
