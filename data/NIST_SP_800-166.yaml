abstract:
- content: NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-157 contains technical guidelines for
    the implementation of standards-based, secure, reliable, interoperable Public
    Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based identity credentials that are issued for mobile
    devices by federal departments and agencies to individuals who possess and prove
    control over a valid Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card. This document,
    SP 800-166, contains the requirements and test assertions for testing the Derived
    PIV Application and associated Derived PIV data objects implemented on removable
    hardware tokens and within mobile devices. The tests reflect the design goals
    of interoperability and interface functions.
