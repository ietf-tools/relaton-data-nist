abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients
    Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat
    -soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes
    the design of and results for the Winter, Spring and Fall 1989 MMQAP measurement
    comparability improvement studies: 1) Round Robin XV Fat-Soluble Vitamins and
    Carotenoids in Human Serum, 2) Round Robin XVI FatSoluble Vitamins and Carotenoids
    in Human Serum, and 3) Round Robin XVII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in
    Human Serum. The materials for Round Robin XV were shipped to participants in
    January 1989; participants were requested to provide their measurement results
    by February 6, 1989. The materials for Round Robin XVI were shipped to participants
    in April 1989; participants were requested to provide their measurement results
    by May 15, 1989. The materials for Round Robin XVII were shipped to participants
    in August 1989; participants were requested to provide their measurement results
    by October 1, 1989.'
