abstract:
- content: Accurate quantitative data on cement and clinker microstructure images
    can prove valuable for monitoring and controlling the manufacturing of cement-based
    powders. Furthermore, quantitative characterization of microstructure is an essential
    input to microstructure-based computer models of cementitious material processing
    and properties. This document describes the use and operating principles of MicroChar,
    a computer application for automatically calculating a range of microstructural
    properties from an indexed 2D image. Among the properties calculated are the volume
    fraction, mass fraction, and surface area fraction of each phase in the image,
    as well as two-point correlation functions for quantifying the spatial distribution
    of the phases throughout the structure. The application also enables the user
    to package the data obtained on cement powders for uploading to the Virtual Cement
    and Concrete Testing Laboratory Consortium (VCCTL) software.
