abstract:
- content: The objective of this task was to develop a comprehensive long-range plan
    to research the seismic behavior of deep, slender wide flange structural steel
    beam-columns in steel frames. Development of the plan included the investigation
    of available information on beam-column member and connection behavior in the
    literature, and considered the differences and interrelationships between member,
    subassemblage, and system performance. The resulting plan includes a summary of
    tasks for conducting both experimental and analytical research, and is intended
    to be the first step in the development of national consensus guidelines for designing
    and assessing the seismic performance of deep, slender wide-flange beam-columns
    in steel frame systems.
