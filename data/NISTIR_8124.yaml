abstract:
- content: This report summarizes the results from the OAGi/NIST Workshop on Open
    Cloud Architecture for Smart Manufacturing, which was held at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology on May 5, 2015. The workshop was a forum for manufacturers
    and providers of IoT technologies, Cloud platforms, and manufacturing services
    to share their visions, and identify and prioritize barriers to adoption of Cloud-enabling
    capabilities and technologies, forming a basis for future follow-on events. The
    report (1) includes summaries as well as full presentations delivered at the workshop;
    (2) identifies and prioritizes technical issues; (3) summarizes the discussions
    that took place during the workshop; and (4) provides the conclusions that emerged
    from the presentations and discussions.
