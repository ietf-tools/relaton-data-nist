abstract:
- content: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose price is pegged to that of another
    asset (typically one with low price volatility). The market for stablecoins has
    grown tremendously â€“ up to almost $200 billion USD in 2022. These coins are being
    used extensively in newly developing paradigms for digital money and commerce
    as well as for decentralized finance technology. This work provides a technical
    description of stablecoin technology to enable reader understanding of the variety
    of ways in which stablecoins are architected and implemented. This includes a
    descriptive definition, commonly found properties, and distinguishing characteristics,
    as well as an exploration of stablecoin taxonomies, descriptions of the most common
    types, and examples from a list of top stablecoins by market capitalization. This
    document also explores related security, safety, and trust issues with an analysis
    conducted from a computer science and information technology security perspective
    as opposed to the financial analysis and economics focus of much of the stablecoin
    literature.
