abstract:
- content: The goal of this second phase of work is to improve technical aspects of
    nonstructural system design in the areas that will have the largest impact for
    public safety and economic welfare. This report summarizes the body of knowledge
    gathered and developed to advance the understanding of the response of nonstructural
    components to earthquakes. The report also makes recommendations for changes to
    building codes and practice.
