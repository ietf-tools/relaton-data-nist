abstract:
- content: In this Technical Note, we report on investigations toward an SI-traceable
    dynamic calibration of instrumented Charpy strikers, performed at NIST from January
    to December 2017. Although Charpy tests are few-millisecond-duration events in
    which dynamic phenomena are often clearly present, the force measurements from
    instrumented Charpy tests are predominantly obtained using static calibrations,
    which has long been recognized as a source of significant potential errors. We
    discuss a number of approaches to dynamic calibration, including methods that
    have previously been implemented at NIST (and elsewhere), and methods that are
    new in the sense that they are not presently commonly used or incorporated into
    standards. We describe exploratory tests of some of the new calibration approaches,
    the results of these tests, and how the information obtained is being applied
    to further work. A key objective of these investigations is that the calibration
    be traceable to the International System of Units.
