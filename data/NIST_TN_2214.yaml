abstract:
- content: 'This study analyzes the potential economic impacts from implementation
    of the new tornado load requirements in the ASCE 7-22 Standard: Minimum Design
    Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures, by incorporation
    into the International Building Code (Proposal S63-22 in Ref. [3]) and/or direct
    adoption by Federal, state, and local governments. The Standard requires that
    Risk Category III and IV buildings located in the tornado-prone region (approximately
    equal to the area of the conterminous U.S. east of the Continental Divide) be
    designed to resist tornado loads in addition to wind loads from other types of
    storms. Risk Category III includes buildings that represent a substantial hazard
    to human life in the event of failure (e.g., theaters and other assembly occupancies,
    schools, nursing homes), while Risk Category IV is for essential facilities (e.g.,
    hospitals, fire and police stations, emergency operations centers). The approach
    in this study is to (1) identify the potential numbers of buildings that may be
    impacted, (2) compare tornado loads with existing wind load requirements to understand
    when and where tornado loads will control design, (3) determine what building
    elements will require changes in construction design when tornado loads control,
    and (4) estimate the cost of these changes in construction design. The adoption
    of the new tornado load requirements in the ASCE 7-22 standard will impact a small
    fraction of new buildings in the United States. When excluding residential occupancies
    with less than 50 units, the building stock occupancy types for Risk Category
    III and IV buildings in the tornado-prone region represents 15.0 % of the entire
    U.S. building stock and 18.3 % of the building stock in the tornado-prone region.
    These results are effectively upper bound estimates as tornado loads will not
    control over wind loads for all Risk Category III and IV buildings in the tornado-prone
    region. Whether tornado loads control any aspect of the building design over wind
    loads depends on many different climatological and building characteristics. Geospatial
    analyses are used identify the impacts of several of these variables. In general,
    the tornado design requirements will have the most impact in the central and southeast
    U.S. Case studies are used to estimate the relative magnitude of the potential
    cost impacts of five building elements (roof systems, roof diaphragm, roof joists
    and wide flange beams and girders, exterior wall framing, and foundation anchorages)
    for two building types (elementary school and high school) for wind Exposure Categories
    B and C baseline building designs across nine locations to provide a range of
    potential load requirements and resulting cost implications. The results of the
    case studies show that tornado loads can vary significantly, from less than wind
    loads to more than double the wind loads. Tornado loads will not control for many
    locations and building types, particularly those on the periphery of the tornado-prone
    region. For scenarios in which the tornado loads do control, the construction
    design is often not influenced. Of the nine cities considered in this study, three
    realize cost increases for at least one exposure category for the elementary school
    and six for the high school. Of all the building type location exposure combinations
    (36), only six (three for each building type) realize cost impacts greater than
    0.07 % of the project budget.'
