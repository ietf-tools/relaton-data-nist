abstract:
- content: 'Cone calorimetric experiments of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) and
    FPUF covered with a variety of fire-blocking barrier fabrics (BFs) were used to
    characterize and rank the effectiveness of BFs for reducing the flammability of
    residential upholstered furniture (RUF). In addition to BF properties, it was
    demonstrated that the burning behaviors of the FPUF/BF composites were sensitive
    to a wide range of experimental parameters including the sample configuration,
    heat losses to the underlying support base, and the two-stage pyrolysis behavior
    of the FPUF. Measurements using thermocouples (TCs) placed within the FPUF provided
    insights on FPUF pyrolysis behavior, the collapse rate of FPUF, and the thermal
    protective properties of barrier materials. Seven out of 16 FPUF/BF composites
    exhibited flame extinction during testing. Five out of the seven composites reignited
    when the spark ignition source was reapplied. Reignition allowed BF effectiveness
    to be assessed even for cases with flame extinction. Heat release rate (HRR) temporal
    profiles were measured for bare FPUF and the FPUF/BF composites. For cases where
    large rapid changes in HRR, e.g., during flash burning of a BF, occurred, it was
    necessary to correct the profiles for the finite time response of the cone calorimeter.
    The HRR curves for FPUF consisted of two distinct burning periods which were previously
    associated with sequential burning of foam pyrolyzates derived from the isocyanate
    and deposited liquid polyol components used in its manufacture. Tests with two
    different underlying substrates demonstrated the sensitivity of the second-stage
    liquid burning to heat losses from the sample holder. The majority of the HRR
    curves for the FPUF/BF composites showed evidence for three-stage burning, which
    was attributed to initial flash burning of the BF followed by the two-stage burning
    of the underlying FPUF. For most of the composites, the largest HRR peak, which
    is often used as the primary indicator for a material''s flammability, occurred
    during the short-lived burning of the BF. Since this is not an appropriate measure
    of BF effectiveness, it is proposed here that effectiveness should be based on
    a BF''s ability to reduce the HRR from the underlying FPUF. In general, the presence
    of a BF was shown to reduce the HRR peak values during both FPUF burning stages.
    The magnitude of the peak associated with second-stage FPUF burning (denoted PHRR2)
    was deemed the most appropriate for characterizing the thermal protection provided
    by a BF. Since the times for PHRR2 also varied between composites, a measurement
    referred to as the peak fire growth rate (PFIGRA) parameter was calculated by
    dividing the PHRR by time since time to ignition was also considered for characterizing
    the BFs. Three possible classification schemes, each consisting of three classes,
    were introduced based on composite flame extinction and reignition behavior, PHRR2
    values, and PFIGRA2 values. Each scheme provided differentiation between BF effectiveness.
    While the schemes were able to assess whether the BFs were particularly effective
    or ineffective, there were variations among classes of BFs having intermediate
    levels of effectiveness. Further work will be required to assess which, if any,
    of the classification schemes are most appropriate for predicting BF performance
    in RUF. BF performance was shown to be associated with four properties that were
    previously identified as important BF properties: BF flammability, gas permeability,
    thermal protection, and physical integrity. In addition, the current experiments
    indicate the presence and effectiveness of gas-phase active flame retardants in
    the BF can also play an important role. A limited number of tests were conducted
    to de-couple the effects of flame-retardant chemicals and physical effects of
    BFs on FPUF burning behavior. These tests showed that while flameretardant chemicals
    can be effective in quenching and extinguishing the flames, the presence of effective
    BF shells is also very important in lowering the HRR of burning FPUF.'
