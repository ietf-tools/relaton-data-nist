abstract:
- content: 'Phase I of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Transactive
    Energy (TE) Modeling and Simulation Challenge for the Smart Grid spanned September
    2015 to September 2016. The TE Challenge was initiated to identify existing simulation
    tools and expertise that might be developed or combined in co-simulation platforms
    to enable the evaluation of transactive energy approaches. Seven teams composed
    of multiple organizations participated in the TE Challenge. This report introduces
    the teams and summarizes accomplishments from the TE Challenge, which include:
    definition of TE scenarios and reference grid components; development of a common
    platform component model for co-simulation; analysis of the TE regulatory environment;
    analysis of common transactive services; and development of a reference architecture
    for TE in a microgrid environment.'
