abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a scientific
    research agency that works to advance measurement science, standards, and technology
    and that has been working to strengthen forensic science methods for almost a
    century. In recent years, several scientific advisory bodies [1-3] have expressed
    the need for scientific foundation reviews of forensic disciplines and identified
    NIST as an appropriate agency for conducting them. The purpose of a scientific
    foundation review is to identify and document information supporting methods and
    practices used in forensic analysis and to identify knowledge gaps where they
    exist. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, Congress appropriated funds for NIST to
    conduct scientific foundation reviews [4]. NIST has begun reviews of DNA mixture
    interpretation, bitemark analysis, digital evidence, and firearms examination.
    In addition to providing insights into these specific disciplines, the initial
    reviews serve as pilot studies which will guide future efforts. This document
    outlines NIST's approach to conducting scientific foundation reviews, including
    data sources used, evaluation criteria, and expected outputs.
