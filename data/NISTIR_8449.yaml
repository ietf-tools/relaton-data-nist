abstract:
- content: In 2020, NIST launched Cannabis Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (CannaQAP)
    to improve the comparability of the analytical measurements of cannabis and cannabis-derived
    products in forensic and cannabis (hemp and marijuana) testing laboratories. CannaQAP
    is an interlaboratory study mechanism that is similar to a proficiency testing
    scheme; however, the focus is towards education without assigning pass/fail grades
    to the anonymized participants. CannaQAP helps inform NIST about the current measurement
    capabilities of, and challenges faced by the analytical cannabis community. This
    in turn assists NIST in the design and characterization of cannabis reference
    materials (RMs). This study of Exercise 2 of CannaQAP focused on the determination
    of moisture in one hemp material provided by NIST. This report provides a detailed
    description of the results of this study. The wide range of moisture loss reported
    by participating laboratories using several different drying methods indicates
    the need for consistent hemp drying method(s) for accurate and precise measurements.
