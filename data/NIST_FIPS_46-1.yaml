abstract:
- content: The selective application of technological and related procedural safeguards
    is an important responsibility of every Federal organization in providing adequate
    security to its ADP systems. This publication provides a standard to be used by
    Federal organizations when these organizations specify that cryptographic protection
    ia to be used for 11emitive or valuable computer data. Protection of computer
    data during transmission between electronic components or while in storage may
    be necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the Information
    represented by that data. The standard specifies an encryption algorithm which
    is to be implemented in an el.ectronJc device for use in Federal ADP systems and
    networks. The algorithm uniquely defines the mathematical steps required to transform
    computer data into a cryptographic cipher. It also specifies the steps required
    to transform the cipher back to its original form. A device performing this algorithm
    may be used in many applications areas where cryptographic data protection is
    needed. Within the context of a total security program comprising physical security
    procedures, good information management practices and computer system/network
    access controls, the Data Encryption Standard is being made available for use
    by Federal agencies. This revision supersedes FIPS 46.
