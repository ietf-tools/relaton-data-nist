abstract:
- content: The February 2017 Road Mapping Workshop on Overcoming Barriers to Adoption
    of Composites in Infrastructure brought together designers, manufacturers, researchers,
    and end-users to identify barriers and potential solutions. Composite products
    produced in the US offer durable, sustainable, and cost-effective solutions in
    a variety of infrastructure applications as diverse as dams, levees, bridges,
    highways, railroads, harbors, utility poles, and buildings. The overall goal of
    the workshop was to enable the adoption of world-leading US composite technology,
    thereby saving construction costs, and creating a durable 21st century infrastructure
    that supports economic growth. The workshop was a seminal event; it was the first
    time that such a complete cross section of interests was assembled to address
    the specific issue of enabling composites adoption in infrastructure. The meeting
    identified three activities (Durability Testing, Design Data Clearinghouse, and
    Training and Education) that, if enacted, will facilitate wider adoption of technology
    that is more reliable, durable, and cost effective. The workshop resulted in a
    roadmap for addressing barriers to the adoption of composites in infrastructure.
