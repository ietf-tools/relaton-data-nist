abstract:
- content: Mixing rules are proposed and used to correlate well-mixed forest fuel
    bed fire spread data from the literature using the dimensionless correlations
    previously developed for singlespecies forest fuel bed fire spread with the help
    of dimensional analysis and the resulting dimensionless groups. The mixing rules
    provide means to treat well-mixed fuels as pseudo single-species fuels. As a first
    attempt with very limited experimental data, the dimensionless correlations for
    single-species fuels may be applicable to mixed-species fuels with proper mixing
    rules.
