abstract:
- content: A workshop on possible contributions of cement and concrete technology
    to energy conservation by the year 2000 was held at the National Bureau of Standards
    on October 3 and 4, 1977. The purpose of the workshop was to identify and record
    ideas on possible contributions of cement and concrete technology to energy conservation
    in the near term and by the year 2000. This included consideration of current
    technology as well as areas in which technological advances might be realized.
    The workshop was divided into working groups on cement composition, cement production,
    blending materials, concrete production, efficient use of concrete, and institutional
    factors. The essential results from the six working groups were statements of
    Energy-Saving Opportunities, Research Needs, and Unresolved Issues. The statements,
    which are the major part of this report, are presented without critical analysis.
    They suggest, however, that there are a large number of possible opportunities
    which should be evaluated for their ability to contribute to energy conservation
    in the cement and concrete industries.
