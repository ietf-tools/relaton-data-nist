abstract:
- content: Title III of the E-Government Act, titled the Federal Information Security
    Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, tasked NIST to develop (1) standards to be used
    by all Federal agencies to categorize information and information systems collected
    or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives of providing
    appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels;
    and (2) guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems
    to be included in each such category. Special Publication 800-60 was issued in
    response to the second of these tasks. The revision to Volume I contains the basic
    guidelines for mapping types of information and information systems to security
    categories. The appendices contained in Volume I include security categorization
    recommendations and rationale for mission-based and management and support information
    types.
