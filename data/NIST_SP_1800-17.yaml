abstract:
- content: As retailers in the United States have adopted chip-and-signature and chip-and-PIN
    (personal identification number) point-of-sale (POS) security measures, there
    have been increases in fraudulent online card-not-present (CNP) electronic commerce
    (e-commerce) transactions. The risk of increased fraudulent online shopping became
    more widely known following the adoption of chip-and-PIN technology that increased
    security at the POS in Europe. The NCCoE at NIST built a laboratory environment
    to explore methods to implement multifactor authentication (MFA) for online retail
    environments for the consumer and the e-commerce platform administrator. The NCCoE
    also implemented logging and reporting to display authentication-related system
    activity. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates to online retailers
    that it is possible to implement open standards-based technologies to enable Universal
    Second Factor (U2F) authentication at the time of purchase when risk thresholds
    are exceeded. The example implementations outlined in this guide encourage online
    retailers to adopt effective MFA implementations by using standard components
    and custom applications that are composed of open- source and commercially available
    components.
