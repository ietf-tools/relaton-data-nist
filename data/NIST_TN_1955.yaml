abstract:
- content: Mobile manipulators are being marketed for material handling and other
    tasks. Manufacturers suggest the stability of the vehicle best when the onboard
    loading tapers the centroid to the center of the wheelbase as the payload height
    increases. Experiments were performed at NIST that verify this notion on an Adept
    Lynx mobile robot with onboard Universal Robot UR5 manipulator. Results show that
    cantilevered loads near the payload top height cause vehicle instability during
    navigation that can roll the vehicle and cause off-path navigation. This paper
    describes the stability experiments and results.
