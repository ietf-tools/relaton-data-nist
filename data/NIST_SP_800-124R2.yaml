abstract:
- content: Mobile devices were initially personal consumer communication devices,
    but they are now permanent fixtures in enterprises and are used to access modern
    networks and systems to process sensitive data. This publication assists organizations
    in managing and securing these devices by describing available technologies and
    strategies. Security concerns inherent to the usage of mobile devices are explored
    alongside mitigations and countermeasures. Recommendations are provided for the
    deployment, use, and disposal of devices throughout the mobile-device life cycle.
    The scope of this publication includes mobile devices, centralized device management,
    and endpoint protection technologies, as well as both organization-provided and
    personally owned deployment scenarios.
