abstract:
- content: The report specifies the various categories, subcategories, and requirements
    for a successful submission, including security characterization, technical description,
    open-source implementation, and performance evaluation. The process intends to
    help the NIST cryptographic technology group collect reference material to promote
    a public analysis of the viability of threshold schemes and related primitives.
    This will support the NIST multi-party threshold cryptography and privacy-enhancing
    cryptography projects in developing future recommendations.
