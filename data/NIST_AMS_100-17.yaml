abstract:
- content: In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processes, the powder size characteristics,
    like particle shape, particle size (PS), particle size distribution (PSD), and
    the resulting powder bed density (PBD), are key influencing factors of the built
    material properties. To better understand the correlations between the powder
    size characteristics and the powder properties influencing the LPBF process, apparent
    density (AD), flowability, and PBD were measured corresponding to two commercial
    metal powders with different PS and PSD. The powder samples were taken from different
    locations on the build platform to also investigate the variations of these powder
    characteristics resulting from the spreading process by the stiff recoater blade.
    It was shown that the PS and PSD had a significant effect on the AD and the PBD.
    Powders with a wide PSD and with particle sizes in the range of the effective
    powder layer thickness, led to a higher PBD than powder with a high proportion
    of finer particles. No significant differences in PS and PSD were observed as
    powder was pushed across a build plate by the recoater blade.
