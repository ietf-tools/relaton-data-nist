abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for security program
    manager, technical managers, functional managers, and other information technology
    (IT) staff members who deal with systems concerning when and how to perform tests
    for network security vulnerabilities and policy implementation. This document
    identifies network testing requirements and how to prioritize testing activities
    with limited resources. It describes security testing techniques and tools. This
    document provides guidance to assist organizations in avoiding redundancy and
    duplication of effort by providing a consistent approach to network security testing
    throughout an organization's networks. Furthermore, this document provides a feasible
    approach for organizations by offering varying levels of network security testing
    as mandated by an organization's mission and security objectives.The main focus
    of this document is the basic information about techniques and tools for individuals
    to begin a testing program. This document is by no means all-inclusive and individuals
    and organizations should consult the references provided in this document as well
    as vendor production descriptions and other sources of information.
