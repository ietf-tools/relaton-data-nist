abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides calibration
    services for hydrometers by Cuckow s method, i.e. by weighing the hydrometer while
    it is immersed to specified scale markings in a liquid of known density (tridecane).
    Normally a calibration is done at three points, at approximately 10 %, 50 %, and
    90 % of the scale. The calibration report includes a simple equation for each
    calibration point that gives the user a correction to the hydrometer reading that
    accounts for the surface tension of the liquid in which the hydrometer is used.
    The calibration results have an expanded uncertainty (with coverage factor of
    2) of 100 parts in 10^6 or less of the liquid density. The apparatus was validated
    by comparisons using liquids of known density: water, toluene, tridecane, and
    trichloroethylene. Results from these comparisons agreed within 40 parts in 10^6
    or less.'
