abstract:
- content: 'A new Standard Reference Material (SRM) for portland cement clinker has
    been produced for the Office of Standard Reference Materials at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST). The SRM clinkers are intended for use in developing
    and testing quantitative methods of phase analysis for portland cement and cement
    clinker. The new SRM is one of three clinkers available from NIST representing
    the range of textures and compositions of North American clinker production. As
    the original SRM stock for SRM2687 has been depleted, new material was obtained
    that retained the fine-grained texture of that SRM. Certification of the phase
    composition of the clinker is based upon consensus means and uncertainties of
    two independent analytical methods: scanning electron microscopy with image analysis
    and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses. The XRD data were subdivided to provide
    two separate sample sets and were processed by two different Rietveld refinement
    codes. These codes differed slightly in the determination of the silicate phases,
    which have very similar powder diffraction patterns and can be difficult to decompose.
    Therefore, the input data set for determination of the consensus means, uncertainties
    and informational values is composed of two distinct XRD data sets and one SEM/image
    analysis data set. The XRD data are close to that determined by microscopy, but
    some distinct differences are seen. The disagreements may reflect the difficulty
    in resolving the fine-sized aluminate and ferrite interstitial phases using the
    microscope and challenges in decomposing highly overlapped powder diffraction
    data. The XRD data do display greater precision than replicate measurements by
    microscopy, likely the result of the specimen homogenization resulting from grinding
    the clinker to a powder. The certified reference values are consensus values,
    calcuated by combining the results from both measurement techniques using the
    DerSimonian-Laird method with the standard un'
