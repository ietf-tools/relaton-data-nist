abstract:
- content: During Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, a study (presented in NIST IR8424) was conducted
    at NIST to identify the optimal combination of heat treatment (specifically, final
    tempering temperature) and side-groove depth for super-high energy reference Charpy
    specimens of 9310 steel. During FY23, a second phase of this investigation took
    place, wherein two additional values of the final tempering temperature were tested,
    while keeping the side-groove depth at the value previously established (0.9 mm/side,
    corresponding to 18 % of the original thickness). In consideration of the overall
    activities performed, final recommendations concerning the final tempering temperature
    and the side-groove depth are formulated for future NIST reference specimens of
    super-high energy level, manufactured from 9310 steel.
