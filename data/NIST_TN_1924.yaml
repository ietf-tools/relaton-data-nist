abstract:
- content: Automated commissioning tools facilitate the ongoing commissioning process
    to improve occupant comfort, ensure the persistence of correct system operation,
    and reduce energy consumption. These tools decrease the time and the skill level
    required to carry out necessary quality assurance measures and as a result, they
    enable more thorough testing of building heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning
    (HVAC) systems. The purpose of the research effort described in this paper is
    to develop, test and demonstrate an automated commissioning tool that detects
    common mechanical faults and control errors in air handing units (AHUs). This
    paper presents the HVAC-Cx software, a tool developed by the U.S. National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST). It utilizes actual air-handling unit data
    obtained from a building automation system and analyzes the data for proper operation
    by comparing the actual performance of the installed system against a set of expert
    rules for the system. This paper examined the effectiveness of the tool in detecting
    faults and documents the results from the first field application to air-handling
    units.
