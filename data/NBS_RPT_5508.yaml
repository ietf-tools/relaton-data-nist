abstract:
- content: The object of this study is to investigate over-water tropospheric propagation
    characteristics for both within and beyond line-of-sight paths. Information on
    the reliability of propagation and on variations in the velocity of propagation
    will be obtained for various tropospheric conditions. These measurements will
    supplement the measurements obtained in the Cheyenne Mountain experiment and will
    have particular application to ground-to-ground propagation in the Pacific coast
    region.
