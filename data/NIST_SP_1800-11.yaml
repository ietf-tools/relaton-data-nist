abstract:
- content: Businesses face a near-constant threat of destructive malware, ransomware,
    malicious insider activities, and even honest mistakes that can alter or destroy
    critical data. These data corruption events could cause a significant loss to
    a company s reputation, business operations, and bottom line. These types of adverse
    events, that ultimately impact data integrity, can compromise critical corporate
    information including emails, employee records, financial records, and customer
    data. It is imperative for organizations to recover quickly from a data integrity
    attack and trust the accuracy and precision of the recovered data.
