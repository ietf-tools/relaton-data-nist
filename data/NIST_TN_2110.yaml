abstract:
- content: HVACSIM+ (HVAC SIMulation PLUS other systems) was introduced by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1985 as a computer simulation
    tool to simulate building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
    The HVACSIM+ computer program package and manuals have been distributed to hundreds
    of researchers, students, and consultants in countries around the world 1. HVACSIM+
    input files are configured through a text-based interface, as was common for programs
    developed in that era. Reviewing the configuration files defining a model in a
    text editor is a tedious, difficult and error-prone process for a large simulation.
    The HVACSIM+ Configuration Tool provides a method to visualize the complicated
    connections between components in a HVACSIM+ model and assist with validation
    and modifications to those models. This user s guide assumes a working knowledge
    of HVACSIM+ .
