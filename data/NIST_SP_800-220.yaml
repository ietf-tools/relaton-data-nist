abstract:
- content: During Fiscal Year 2021 (FY 2021) from October 1, 2020, through September
    30, 2021 the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity and Privacy
    Program successfully responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in security
    and privacy. This annual report highlights the FY 2021 research agenda and activities
    for the ITL Cybersecurity and Privacy Program, including the ongoing participation
    and development of international standards; the enhancement of privacy and security
    risk management models, including those for the protection of controlled unclassified
    information (CUI), systems engineering and cyber resiliency, supply chains, and
    mobile technologies; the continued advancement of cryptographic technologies,
    including updates to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication
    140-3, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, and preparation for post-quantum
    cryptographic methods; and improved infrastructure protection in areas such as
    zero trust architectures and advanced networking security. NIST maintained a strong
    focus on supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), including updates
    to the Small Business Cybersecurity Corner website to make resources easier to
    find and use and drawing on contributed cybersecurity resources and feedback received
    from federal partners and the public.
