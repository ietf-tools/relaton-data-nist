abstract:
- content: A quantity value, such as 5 kg, consists of a number and a reference (often
    an International System of Units (SI) unit) that together express the magnitude
    of a quantity. Many software libraries, packages, and ontologies that implement
    quantities and units functions are available. Although all of them begin with
    SI and associated practices, they differ in how they address issues such as ad
    hoc counting units, ratios of two quantities of the same kind, and uncertainty.
    This short technical note describes an architecture that addresses the complete
    set of functions in a simple and consistent fashion. Its goal is to encourage
    more convergent thinking about the functions and the underlying concepts so that
    the many disparate implementations, present and future, will become more consistent
    with one another.
