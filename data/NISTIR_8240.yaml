abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of
    selecting one or more public-key cryptographic algorithms through a public competition-like
    process. The new public-key cryptography standards will specify one or more additional
    digital signature, public-key encryption, and key-establishment algorithms to
    augment FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), as well as special publications
    SP 800-56A Revision 2, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes
    Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography, and SP 800-56B, Recommendation for Pair-Wise
    Key-Establishment Schemes Using Integer Factorization. It is intended that these
    algorithms will be capable of protecting sensitive information well into the foreseeable
    future, including after the advent of quantum computers. In November 2017, 82
    candidate algorithms were submitted to NIST for consideration. Among these, 69
    met both the minimum acceptance criteria and our submission requirements, and
    were accepted as First-Round Candidates on Dec. 20, 2017, marking the beginning
    of the First Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process.
    This report describes the evaluation criteria and selection process, based on
    public feedback and internal review of the first-round candidates, and summarizes
    the 26 candidate algorithms announced on January 30, 2019 for moving forward to
    the second round of the competition. The 17 Second-Round Candidate public-key
    encryption and key-establishment algorithms are BIKE, Classic McEliece, CRYSTALS-KYBER,
    FrodoKEM, HQC, LAC, LEDAcrypt (merger of LEDAkem/LEDApkc), NewHope, NTRU (merger
    of NTRUEncrypt/NTRU-HRSS-KEM), NTRU Prime, NTS-KEM, ROLLO (merger of LAKE/LOCKER/Ouroboros-R),
    Round5 (merger of Hila5/Round2), RQC, SABER, SIKE, and Three Bears. The 9 Second-Round
    Candidates for digital signatures are CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM, FALCON, GeMSS, LUOV,
    MQDSS, Picnic, qTESLA, Rainbow, and SPHINCS+.
