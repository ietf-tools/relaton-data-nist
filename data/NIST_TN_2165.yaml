abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology is currently conducting
    a series of large compartment fire tests to investigate the behavior and fire-induced
    failure mechanisms of the full-scale composite floor systems situated in the two-story
    and two-bays by three-bays structural steel frame. This report presents the research
    background, details of experimental design involved with the two-story test building,
    and the results from the first fire experiment (Test #1) conducted at the National
    Fire Research Laboratory. The Test #1 was aimed to quantify the fire resistance
    and behavior of a steel composite floor system commonly built in the United States,
    incorporating prescriptive approaches for a 2-hour fire resistance rating. The
    9.1 m 6.1 m test floor assembly built in the middle edge bay in the floor plan
    of the test building was tested to failure under a natural gas fueled compartment
    fire simulating the standard furnace temperature-time relationship while sustaining
    hydraulically applied mechanical loads. This study showed that the protected floor
    beams and girders of the test floor assembly achieved matching or superior fire
    resistance based on the acceptance criteria of standard furnace testing. However,
    the test floor slab exhibited a potential fire hazard prior to reaching a specified
    fire rating period because of the use of a minimum code-compliant shrinkage reinforcement
    (59 mm2/m). The heated slab cracked around the interior edges of the test bay
    less than 30 min into heating, followed by slab breach in the middle of the test
    bay at 70 min. This center breach, accompanied by ruptures of embedded wire reinforcement,
    was caused by catenary action developed along the shorter span of the test floor
    assembly. This result suggests that the minimum slab reinforcement prescribed
    for normal conditions may not be sufficient to activate tensile membrane action
    of a composite floor system under the 2-hour standard fire exposure.'
