abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently released
    SRM 2386 Avocado Powder which has value assignment for over 70 analytes. This
    material has certified values assigned for 22 analytes and non-certified values
    assigned for 53 analytes and is intended to be used for the evaluation of methods
    for the determination of elements, vitamins, amino acids, fatty acids, and proximates
    in this and similar matrices. The material was purchased pre-packaged from a commercial
    vendor and data was obtained from NIST and interlaboratory comparison exercises.
    A description of the material, sample preparations, results, and data analysis
    are discussed in the following report.
