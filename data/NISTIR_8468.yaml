abstract:
- content: The Dimensional Metrology Group (DMG) at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) has a unique 60 m long length facility that provides traceable
    reference lengths for the evaluation of measuring tapes, optical fibers, electronic
    distance meters, laser trackers and terrestrial laser scanners. In this report,
    we compare three methods to evaluate the ranging error of laser trackers in this
    facility. These include the back-to-back, the common path single pass, and the
    common path double pass method. We describe the different methods and compare
    them in terms of their advantages and disadvantages.
