abstract:
- content: This document is intended to be a practical guide used by engineers and
    managers facilitating them to go through the process of defining the objectives
    of their wireless systems and examining the environments where the wireless systems
    are to be deployed, then helping them in selecting, designing, deploying, and
    monitoring the wireless systems using existing technology in a factory. Sufficient
    background materials about wireless technologies are provided, so that the users
    have some basic understanding of wireless systems being addressed. Thus the document
    is aimed to be a light-weighted, easy-to-use, reference guide, equipped with checklists
    throughout the lifecycle of wireless technology from concept and design to deployment
    and monitoring.
