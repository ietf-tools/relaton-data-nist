abstract:
- content: This manual describes the computer program CONTAM version 3.4, developed
    by NIST. CONTAM is a multizone indoor air quality and ventilation analysis program
    designed to help determine airflows, contaminant concentrations, and occupant
    exposure in buildings. CONTAM can calculate infiltration and exfiltration airflows
    between interior zones of the building and the outdoors, room-to-room airflows,
    and ventilation system airflows. These airflows are the result of pressure differences
    resulting from driving forces which include mechanical ventilation system fans,
    wind pressures acting on the exterior of the building, and buoyancy effects induced
    by temperature differences between zones, including the outdoors. CONTAM can also
    calculate contaminant concentrations to account for the transport and fate of
    airborne contaminants due to airflow, chemical and radio-chemical transformation,
    adsorption and desorption of building materials, filtration, and deposition to
    and resuspension from building surfaces. CONTAM can be useful in a variety of
    applications. Its ability to calculate building airflow rates and pressures between
    zones of the building is useful for assessing the adequacy of ventilation rates
    in a building, for determining the variation in ventilation rates over time, for
    determining the distribution of ventilation air within a building, for estimating
    the impact of envelope airtightening efforts on infiltration rates, and for evaluating
    the energy impacts of building airflows. The program has also been used extensively
    for the design and analysis of smoke management systems. The prediction of contaminant
    concentrations can be used to determine the indoor air quality performance of
    buildings before they are constructed and occupied, to investigate the impacts
    of design decisions related to ventilation system design and building material
    selection, to evaluate indoor air quality control technologies, and to assess
    the indoor air quality performance of existing buildings. Predicted contaminant
    concentrations can also be used to estimate personal exposure based on occupancy
    patterns and activities, and occupants can also act as contaminant sources as
    they move throughout the building.
