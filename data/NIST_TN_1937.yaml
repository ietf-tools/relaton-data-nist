abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with support
    from the Department of Homeland Security has been working with the National Fire
    Protection Association (NFPA) to develop standards and test methods for radio-frequency
    personal alert safety systems (RF PASS). The RF PASS systems are incorporated
    into a firefighter''s gear and are used to alert a base station when the firefighter
    is in distress, has been motionless for more than 30 seconds, or to alert the
    firefighter in case an evacuation is necessary. The material here covers the development
    of several test methods either already adopted by the NFPA or targeted for future
    revisions of NFPA 1982 Personal Alert Safety Systems. These test methods represent
    five RF PASS deployment conditions: a highly reflective (high multipath) RF environment;
    a prescribed amount of attenuation in a point- to-point communication link; a
    multi-hop connection path; in-band wireless activity; and temporary exposure to
    high-power, in-band RF interference. The data and developed testing are based
    on currently used RF PASS frequencies: 450 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2.4 GHz.'
