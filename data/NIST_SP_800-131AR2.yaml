abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides cryptographic
    key management guidance for defining and implementing appropriate key management
    procedures, using algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information, and
    planning ahead for possible changes in the use of cryptography because of algorithm
    breaks or the availability of more powerful computing techniques. NIST Special
    Publication (SP) 800- 57, Part 1, Recommendation for Key Management: General,
    includes a general approach for transitioning from one algorithm or key length
    to another. This Recommendation (SP 800-131A) provides more specific guidance
    for transitions to the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms.'
