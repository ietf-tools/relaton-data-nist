abstract:
- content: The Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a survey to explore ways
    in which drones, or Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), are currently being used
    in public safety operations and identify potential opportunities for drones to
    improve operations in the future. The participants of the survey included 183
    first responders, and the responses were collected in the time period of April
    through July 2019. The results and further analysis of the survey are explored
    in this report.
