abstract:
- content: Additive manufacturing is a rapidly growing and increasingly important
    set of manufacturing techniques. One of those techniques, powder bed fusion, is
    often used when making metal parts. The part is built up by spreading a thin layer
    of metal powder, melting that layer, and repeating. However, how that powder flows
    as it is spread can affect the ultimate part quality. Powder flow characteristics
    during spreading are poorly understood. This paper describes an image-based powder
    particle tracking method to better understand the motions of the particles during
    the powder spreading process. It presents preliminary data obtained from two prototype
    powder spreading testbeds. Such measurements should ultimately enable the validation
    of physics-based models for powder spreading as well as an understanding of the
    effects of bulk powder characteristics on the spreading performance.
