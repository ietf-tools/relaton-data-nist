abstract:
- content: Based on the collaborative framework established between ASME, NASA, and
    NIST, quasi-static tensile tests were performed in liquid nitrogen (77 K) and
    liquid helium (4 K) on tensile specimens extracted from the centers of four welded
    316L stainless steel plates, each produced by a different vendor. Relatively large
    differences in strength, elongation, and reduction in area were observed between
    the welds with the strongest two welds (W4 and W2) exhibiting a nearly 20 % difference
    in 4 K ultimate tensile strength when compared to the welds with the lowest 4
    K tensile strength (W1 and W3). As the testing temperature decreases from 77 K
    to 4 K, all welds exhibit an increase in yield strength, plus an attenuation in
    total elongation and reduction in area. Serrated yielding was observed at every
    test conducted at 4 K. The tensile properties reported in this work will be used
    during analysis of future fracture toughness (single edge notch bending) testing
    conducted at 77 K and 4 K on the same four sets of welded plates.
