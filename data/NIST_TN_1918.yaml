abstract:
- content: Building stakeholders need practical metrics, data, and tools to support
    decisions related to sustainable building designs, technologies, standards, and
    codes. The Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has addressed this high priority national need by extending its metrics
    and tools for sustainable building products, known as Building for Environmental
    and Economic Sustainability (BEES), to whole-buildings. Wholebuilding sustainability
    metrics have been developed based on innovative extensions to life-cycle assessment
    (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches involving whole-building energy
    simulations. The measurement system evaluates the sustainability of both the materials
    and the energy used by a building over time. It assesses the carbon footprint
    of buildings as well as 11 other environmental performance metrics, and integrates
    economic performance metrics to yield science-based measures of the business case
    for investment choices in high-performance green buildings.
