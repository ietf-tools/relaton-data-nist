abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM) 915c Calcium Carbonate is certified as
    a chemical substance of known purity. It is intended for use in the calibration
    and standardization of procedures for calcium (Ca) determinations employed in
    clinical analysis and for routine critical evaluation of the daily working standards
    used in these procedures. A unit of SRM 915c consists of a single glass bottle
    containing 20 g of the material. This publication documents the production, analytical
    methods, and computations involved in characterizing this product.
