abstract:
- content: This publication describes an example methodology for assessing an organization's
    Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) program. It was developed directly
    from NIST guidance and is applicable to any organization, public or private. It
    can be used as documented or as the starting point for a different methodology.
    Included with the methodology is a reference implementation that is directly usable
    for conducting an ISCM assessment.
