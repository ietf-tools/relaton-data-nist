abstract:
- content: In this report, we provide derivations for two equations that serve as
    the basis for the direct-comparison system, a transfer technique for comparing
    microwave power sensors. The system consists of a synthesizer that provides a
    signal to the input of a power divider. A monitor power sensor is connected to
    one of the divider's output ports. During the first portion of the measurement,
    a transfer standard is connected to the other output port of the divider, and
    the powers of the transfer standard and monitor are measured. Next, the transfer
    standard is replaced with an unknown power sensor to be calibrated, and the powers
    of the unknown device and monitor are measured. Utilizing rules governing flow-diagrams
    for scattering-parameters and definitions of delivered power, we derive the effective
    efficiency of an unknown power sensor as a function of the transfer standard's
    effective efficiency in conjunction with power readings of both sensors and a
    monitor sensor, as well as reflection coefficients of the sensors and the equivalent
    source reflection coefficient of the power divider. Our derivation provides the
    definition of the equivalent source reflection coefficient. We also derive a correction
    term for the case when an adapter is connected to the transfer standard. Finally,
    we review the most widely-accepted approach for determining the equivalent source
    reflection coefficient of a three-port device, such as a power divider, and provide
    simplistic and comprehensive derivations that demonstrate its independence of
    external impedance mismatches at two of its ports.
