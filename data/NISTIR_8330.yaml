abstract:
- content: Smart home technologies may expose adopters to increased risk to network
    security, information privacy, and physical safety. However, users may lack understanding
    of the privacy and security implications, while devices fail to provide transparency
    and configuration options. This results in little meaningful mitigation action
    to protect users’ security and privacy. To better understand users’ perceptions
    of smart home privacy and security, we conducted an in-depth interview study of
    40 smart home users. In this document, we report the study findings related to
    perceptions of data collection/use, privacy and security concerns, and mitigations
    employed to alleviate concerns. We found that users have varied, and often unclear,
    understandings of how smart home data are collected and used. In addition, although
    users may have security and privacy concerns, many participants displayed a willingness
    to accept risks in favor of smart home benefits, and they feel limited responsibility
    for mitigating these due to constrained options or lack of knowledge to enact
    more sophisticated countermeasures. While this report is not meant to be prescriptive,
    an understanding of user perceptions may be used to inform future smart home security
    and privacy guidance for manufacturers and users.
