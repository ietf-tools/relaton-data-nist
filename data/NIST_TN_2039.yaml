abstract:
- content: This report documents the measurement of the wind resistance of different
    types of vegetation. The measurements are made in a wind tunnel with a 2.0 m test
    section and 0.5 m by 0.5 m cross- section. Samples of vegetation have been cut
    into cubical volumes that span the cross-section of the tunnel. The wind resistance
    is inferred via measurement of the pressure drop across the sample at wind speeds
    ranging from 2 m/s to 8 m/s. The results are compared to empirical correlations
    quantifying the wind resistance of regularly spaced vertical tubes of comparable
    geometric characteristics.
