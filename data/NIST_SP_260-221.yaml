abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2917 is intended for calibrating qPCR-based
    assays of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) for assessing water quality. A unit of
    SRM 2917 consists of 6?Levels of linearized plasmid DNA. The length of DNA is
    approximately 4.4 kb; it contains 13 single-copy PCR target regions. The 6 Levels
    span a log10 dilution series from approximately (5 to 500,000) plasmid copy per
    uL. Each Level is suspended in 1 TE buffer at pH 8 with approximately 10 ng/uL
    yeast tRNA. Approximately 0.2 mL of each Level were bottled in 1.5 mL skirted
    centrifuge vials. In total, approximately 1000 units were generated. The material
    is both stable and should be stored at 4? C. The production, analytical methods,
    statistical evaluation, and certified values of this SRM are described herein.
