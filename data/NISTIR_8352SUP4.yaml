abstract:
- content: 'This report provides supplemental information to NISTIR 8352 Bitemark
    Analysis: A NIST Scientific Foundation Review. Publicly available resources relating
    to bitemark analysis were collected to assist in the review of the scientific
    foundations of bitemark analysis conducted by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST). Over 400 sources were collected from literature searches
    and input from previous efforts by the National Institute of Justice Forensic
    Technology Center of Excellence, the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO),
    and other public resources. This reference list is meant as a resource for the
    odontology community and interested stakeholders but does not represent an exhaustive
    compilation of the literature pertaining to bitemark analysis.'
