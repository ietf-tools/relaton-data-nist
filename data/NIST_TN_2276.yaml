abstract:
- content: The phishing cyber threat exploits vulnerabilities in the U.S. and around
    the world across private and public sectors. Embedded phishing awareness training
    programs, where simulated phishing emails are sent to employees, are designed
    to prepare employees in these organizations to combat real-world phishing scenarios.
    Cybersecurity and phishing awareness training implementers and practitioners use
    the results of these programs, in part, to assess the security risk of their organization.
    The NIST Phish Scale is a method created for cybersecurity and phishing awareness
    training implementers to rate an emailâ€™s human phishing detection difficulty as
    part of their cybersecurity awareness and phishing training programs. This User
    Guide outlines the Phish Scale in its entirety while providing instructional steps
    on how to apply it to phishing emails. Further, appendices include 1) worksheets
    to assist training implementers in applying the Phish Scale and 2) detailed information
    regarding email properties and associated research in the literature.
