abstract:
- content: This report presents the experimental investigation of a test fire in a
    large compartment of approximately 10 m wide, 7 m deep and 3.8 m high constructed
    in the National Fire Research Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology. The test fire condition, controlled by heat release rate of natural
    gas as a fuel, thermal boundary properties of the compartment, and ventilation,
    was designed to produce a uniform temperature condition in the upper layer of
    the compartment which followed the ASTM E119 time-temperature curve. Three fire
    tests were conducted with the same compartment and natural gas-fueled burners,
    including two repeated 15 min burn tests and one long test with heating duration
    of 75 min from ignition. Fire characteristics such as heat release rates, upper
    layer gas temperatures across the compartment and heat fluxes were measured. The
    measured average upper layer gas temperature was comparable with that prescribed
    in ASTM E119 standard. The maximum absolute difference towards the end of the
    long test was around 70 oC. The upper layer gas temperature was uniform with a
    2% coefficient of variation at the end of the test. The area under time-temperature
    curve, obtained by averaging the results from the readings, is within 2 % of the
    corresponding area under the standard ASTM E119 time-temperature curve. The measured
    peak heat flux towards the end of the long test was 175 kW/m2. The design procedure
    for the test fire, instrumentation and measurements, and the experimental results
    are presented.
