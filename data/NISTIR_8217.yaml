abstract:
- content: As shape analysis of the form presented in Srivastava and Klassen s textbook
    Functional and Shape Data Analysis is intricately related to Lebesgue integration
    and absolute continuity, it is advantageous to have a good grasp of the latter
    two notions. Accordingly, in these notes we review basic concepts and results
    about Lebesgue integra- tion and absolute continuity. In particular, we review
    fundamen- tal results connecting them to each other and to the kind of shape analysis,
    or more generally, functional data analysis presented in the aforemetioned textbook,
    in the process shedding light on important aspects of all three notions. Many
    well-known results, especially most results about Lebesgue integration and some
    results about absolute continuity, are presented without proofs. However, a good
    number of results about absolute continuity and most results about functional
    data and shape analysis are presented with proofs. Actually, most missing proofs
    can be found in Royden s Real Analysis and Rudin s Principles of Mathematical
    Analysis as it is on these textbooks and Srivastava and Klassen s textbook that
    a good portion of these notes are based. However, if the proof of a result does
    not appear in the aforementioned textbooks, nor in some other known publication,
    or if all by itself it could be of value to the reader, an effort has been made
    to present it accordingly.
