abstract:
- content: A large percentage of radio communication transmissions em¿̐¿ ploy binary
    amplitude or frequency modulation of the carrier, and the abrupt changes associated
    with binary modulation generate sideband components which frequently interfere
    with services in adjacent channels. By employing relatively simple filters in
    the keying circuits of linear AM or class C operated frequency-shift-keyed transmitters
    which smooth the transition from mark to space, it is possible to greatly reduce
    the amplitude of these interfering sidebands. The amount of amplitude reduction
    obtained is found by calculations and experimental measurements to be related
    to the attenuation characteristics of the low pass filter for both AM and FSK.
    Characteristics of desirable keying circuit filters to obtain these reductions
    are outlined. The minimum channel spacing required for a given ratio of undesired
    to desired carriers is shown to be determined by both the interfering frequency
    spectrum and the receiver selectivity characteristics. Methods of calculating
    the undesired output under both limiting conditions are described, and several
    typical examples are included.
