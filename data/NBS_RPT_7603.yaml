abstract:
- content: Additional data from the experiments on force decay, sealability, thermal
    expansion, and T are presented, together with brief discussions of the new results.
    Trie high speed rotating seal effort has been reactivated (with partial funding
    from another source) and machining of parts for the tester has begun. A simple
    method for automatic recording of rebound resilience has been developed. Two papers
    presented at the 1962 Cryogenic Engineering Conference are included.
