abstract:
- content: 'The NIST policy on metrological traceability (NIST P 5800.00, which became
    effective on May 31st, 2019) is transcribed and supplemented with a review of
    relevant terminology and with a list of frequently asked questions and answers.
    This list updates and amplifies a similar list originally prepared by a team organized
    and led by Richard Kayser, which was published in the World Wide Web, and comprises
    questions about: metrological traceability in general; establishing metrological
    traceability; NIST and NIST''s role in metrological traceability; NIST products
    and services; and international aspects of traceability.'
