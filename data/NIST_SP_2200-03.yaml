abstract:
- content: Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), which include “all-electric” battery EV
    (BEV) and plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV), comprise a rapidly growing proportion of the
    U.S. automobile market – nearly 8% of all light-duty vehicles sold in Oct. 2022,
    a 41.4% rise over October 2021 sales. In response to projected demands for PEV
    charging, private companies, utilities, and state and local governments have strived
    to develop policies and infrastructure that promote broad access to electric vehicle
    supply equipment (EVSE) used to fuel electric vehicles. However, long-standing
    regulatory oversight of retail electricity distribution and sales through utilities
    has presented ambiguities and constraints regarding the sales of electricity for
    motor vehicle fueling, particularly via public charging stations. As these matters
    are addressed separately by the responsible authorities in each state, a patchwork
    of policies and rules has evolved across the U.S. concerning regulation of public
    EVSE sites and charging-related transactions. These policies, or lack thereof,
    have influenced permissible EVSE site ownership models, methods of sale and pricing
    for charging sessions, and requirements for metrological control of EVSE. Nonuniformity
    in EVSE operations across the U.S. can stimy expansion of interstate charging
    networks, hinder equity in the charging market, frustrate price comparison, and
    diminish consumer confidence. Thus, it is advantageous that many states in recent
    years have begun to adopt some consistent regulatory measures, including changes
    in most states to utility regulations to allow owners of EVSEs to make a profit
    from the sale of electrical energy used as a vehicle fuel. However, significant
    gaps and variation in oversight remain as charging networks expand. Considering
    these developments, this publication summarizes the current, albeit evolving,
    EVSE regulatory landscape in the U.S. and explores the increasingly relevant role
    of legal metrology in PEV charging. The implications of these topics and their
    relation to other currently evolving issues, including submetering for utility
    PEV time of use rates and for PEV fuel excise taxes, are also discussed.
