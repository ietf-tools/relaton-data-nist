abstract:
- content: Throughout the United States, the use of fiber reinforced (FR) composites
    in building and infrastructure applications has been steadily on the rise. FR
    composite materials, which include fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites and
    fiber reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) composites, are used to repair, strengthen,
    and seismically retrofit structural components (e.g., columns, beams, walls) of
    existing buildings and infrastructure. FR composite retrofits have become competitive
    with more traditional retrofit techniques due to their high strength, light weight,
    low profile, and corrosion resistance. These FR composite properties have resulted
    in lower overall costs and more efficient, less labor-intensive installation processes.
    Furthermore, repair, strengthening, and seismic retrofit of aging structures with
    FR composites leads to improved building and infrastructure resilience. Since
    the use of FR composites in the civil engineering field has matured, this report
    serves to review the state-of-the-art for FR composite performance and identify
    research needs requisite to advancing the field. The report focuses primarily
    on externally bonded FRP composites since they are most commonly used in practice
    in the United States. The research needs were obtained by an extensive literature
    review and from input received at a national stakeholder workshop at NIST in 2018.
    The findings of this report describe the materials and structural level research
    needs prioritized per the subject matter expert opinions received at the workshop.
    Major materials research needs include improvement of inspector certification
    processes and improvement or development of test methods that assess the condition
    of FR composites after installation and long-term use. Other major research needs
    include identification of bond degradation mechanisms between FRP composites and
    concrete and relation of accelerated conditioning protocols to long-term exposure
    outdoors. Structural research needs include development of design standards and
    guidelines for FR retrofitted components and buildings, improvement of inspection
    practices, structural-scale experimental studies, and improvement of numerical
    modeling capabilities. This report is intended to inform future research plans
    developed by various stakeholders concerning the performance of buildings and
    infrastructure that are retrofitted or repaired with FR composites.
