abstract:
- content: During the early months of 1961 the National Bureau of Standards established
    a 113 km tropospheric within-the-horizon path in Eastern Colorado in order to
    investigate propagation characteristics of signals in the 9300 Mc/s range over
    such a path. Special attention was given to the short-term fading characteristics
    of the received carrier envelopes, and to the bandwidth capability of the medium.
    The latter was studied by comparing the amplitude variations of two continuous-wave
    carriers separated by 100 Mc/s in the 9300 Mc/s frequency range. Separate antennas
    were used in transmission and reception of the two carriers; consequently, the
    results include the effects of space diversity. In addition to studying the correlation
    of carrier envelopes as a measure of the bandwidth capability, an analysis was
    also made of the distribution of the carrier amplitude ratios, which is related
    to the correlation coefficient, and is believed to be a better indicator, at least
    for line-of-sight paths, of selective fading phenomena. Short-term fading in the
    9300 Mc/s range can be characterized in terms of prolonged space-wave fadeouts,
    which have previously been observed and described for lower carrier frequencies
    over this and similar paths. Fadeouts appear to be well correlated in time of
    occurrence on the two frequencies 9350 and 9350 Mc/s. The fading durations range
    from a few tenths of a minute to 10 minutes, and the maximum observed depth was
    25 db below the median of a five-day observation period. The cross-correlation
    coefficient of instantaneous carrier envelopes separated by 100 Me/s had an overall
    value of 0.91, as determined by sampling of the carrier amplitudes at the rate
    of one per second. The standard deviation of the amplitude ratios averaged 0.76
    db, with a maximum hourly value of 1.81 db. These results support the feasibility
    of wide-band modulation techniques for within- the-horizon paths if evaluated
    by amplitude variations of discrete frequencies within the bandwidth of interest.
    Sufficient margin in transmitter power has to be provided to allow for the short-term
    signal variations observed. Supporting measurements on 1040.1 Mc/s over this path
    confirmed previously established fadeout characteristics with regard to diurnal
    variations, depth, and duration of fadeouts. However, the distribution of hourly
    median signal levels on this frequency showed a much larger month-to-month variation
    than had previously been observed over this path. This is attributed to the small
    sample size available in the current measurement series.
