abstract:
- content: To gain insight into the emergency communication and evacuation decision-making
    surrounding the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 fire, NIST conducted (via a small business
    survey research contractor) an online survey targeting homeowners in the Gatlinburg,
    TN area from October 2018 to May 2019. Among the 323 participants selected in
    our final sample, it was found that the majority were largely unaware of wildfire
    risks and had not experienced evacuations previously. On the day the fire spread
    into residential areas, only a small percentage reported receiving information
    from official sources or official evacuation notices, instead relying more commonly
    on information from the media, social sources, and cues from the fire itself (such
    as smoke, embers, and flames) to become informed about the impending wildfire
    threat. The great majority of the sample evacuated from the area, most commonly
    on the day the fire spread into residential areas in response to intense fire
    cues and feeling afraid for themselves and others. A thematic analysis of voluntary
    end of survey comments provide additional nuance to these findings, in that many
    participants felt unprepared for the evacuation, and took independent action to
    try and get themselves to safety. Recommendations from these findings include
    the need for greater public outreach and awareness of local wildfire risks and
    preparation in the region, as well as what to expect in terms of evacuation procedures.
    In addition to having a better-prepared public, these results highlight the importance
    of giving timely, coordinated, and clear warning messages and signage to avoid
    chaotic or difficult evacuation processes. Specific recommendations on the construction
    of effective warning messages are provided in Section 5, as well as limitations
    of this work.
