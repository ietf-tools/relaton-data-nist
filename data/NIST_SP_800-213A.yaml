abstract:
- content: This publication provides a catalog of internet of things (IoT) device
    cybersecurity capabilities (i.e., features and functions needed from a device
    to support security controls) and non-technical supporting capabilities (i.e.,
    actions and support needed from device manufacturers and other supporting entities
    to support security controls) that can help organizations as they use Special
    Publication (SP) 800-213 to determine and establish device cybersecurity requirements.
    This catalog cross references the capabilities in the catalog to the cybersecurity
    controls in NIST SP 800-53. Organizations should refer to SP 800-213 as that publication
    provides necessary context to effectively use this catalog and related material.
