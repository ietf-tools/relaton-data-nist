abstract:
- content: In 2020, NIST launched CannaQAP to improve the comparability of the analytical
    measurements of cannabis and cannabis-derived products in forensic and cannabis
    (hemp and marijuana) testing laboratories. CannaQAP is an interlaboratory study
    mechanism that is similar to a proficiency testing scheme; however, the focus
    is towards education without assigning pass/fail grades to the anonymized participants.
    CannaQAP helps inform NIST about the current measurement capabilities of, and
    challenges faced by the analytical cannabis community. This in turn assists NIST
    in the design and characterization of cannabis reference materials (RMs). This
    study of CannaQAP Exercise 2 focused on the determination of toxic elements in
    two hemp materials and a control material provided by NIST. Arsenic, cadmium,
    lead, mercury, beryllium, cobalt, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium,
    uranium, and vanadium were the toxic elements chosen based on interest expressed
    by the cannabis community. This report provides a detailed description of the
    results of this study.
