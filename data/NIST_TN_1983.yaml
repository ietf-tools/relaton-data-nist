abstract:
- content: This report presents the experimental design and results of a series of
    localized fire tests on structural steel I-shaped beams. A total of nine tests
    were conducted in the National Fire Research Laboratory, including thermal tests
    (Tests 1 through 5) and four-point bending tests at ambient (Test 6) and elevated
    temperatures (Tests 7 through 9). The specimens were nominally 6.2-m long W16x26
    beams made of ASTM A992 steel. Each specimen was vertically supported with either
    a (i) simple support condition, or (ii) double-angles bolted to laterally braced
    support columns. The thermally-loaded specimens were exposed to fire generated
    using a natural gas burner. The burner had an area of 1 m2 and was located 1.1
    m below the bottom flange of the beam at midspan. A four-point flexural loading
    scheme was used to apply concentrated forces at two locations 2.44 m apart around
    midspan. The recorded data included temperatures, heat release rates from the
    burner, and structural measurements including forces, displacements and strains.
    The repeatability of several measurements was evaluated. The test results indicated
    that the heating rate of the specimen was sensitive to the prescribed heat release
    rate versus time relationship used in each test. However, the thermal gradient
    developed in the fire-exposed cross sections of the beam never achieved linearity
    under the localized fire exposure. When the exposed (bottom) flange temperature
    was maintained to 616 °C, the load-bearing capacity of the simply-supported beam
    was reduced to 67 % of its room-temperature capacity. When the same simply-supported
    beam was initially loaded to 67 % of its room-temperature capacity and then exposed
    to a growing (t-squared) fire, the exposed flange temperature of the beam at failure
    was 663 °C. When the beam specimen was supported by double-angle connections and
    subjected to the same bending moment, its fire resistance (failure temperature)
    was decreased to 90 % of that of the simply-supported beam. Regardless of the
    connection types and fire conditions (steady-state or transient-state fire), the
    beam specimens failed by lateral torsional buckling with rapidly increasing vertical
    displacements.
