abstract:
- content: This document provides federal agencies with a guide for implementing attributes
    in access control systems. Attributes enable a logical access control methodology
    where authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating
    attributes associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in
    some cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or relationships that
    describe the allowable operations for a given set of attributes. This document
    outlines factors which influence attributes that an authoritative body must address
    when standardizing an attribute system and proposes some notional implementation
    suggestions for consideration.
