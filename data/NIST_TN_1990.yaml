abstract:
- content: The set of software metrics introduced by Maurice H. Halstead in the 1970's
    has seen much scrutiny and not infrequent criticism. This article takes a fresh
    look at these metrics using quantity calculus (the algebra of units) and a new
    approach to dimensionless units. In this way, it is possible to assign units to
    the major Halstead metrics in a manner that is logically consistent. However,
    Halstead's repurposing of counts of software attributes as counts of unobservable
    mental events leads to a less plausible, more confusing set of metrics for coding
    effort than for software attributes.
