abstract:
- content: This protocol describes a strategy for separating Caenorhabditis elegans
    (C. elegans) from engineered nanomaterials, a critical step for accurate quantification
    in uptake studies. Conventional rinsing procedures, typically comprised of water
    or buffer rinsing steps followed by centrifugation, have been previously tested
    and deemed unsuitable for this purpose, even at environmentally relevant exposure
    concentrations. Therefore, this protocol details the development and assessment
    of a unique sucrose gradient density centrifugation procedure for the efficient
    separation of nanoparticles and C. elegans at the end of an exposure protocol.
    The example outlined in this SP pertains to the measurement of gold nanoparticles
    (AuNPs) and C. elegans. However, this method can potentially be implemented in
    bioaccumulation studies involving other organisms and with different metallonanoparticles.

    and additions to this protocol or for new protocols in the series. We also encourage
    users to report citations to published work in which this protocol has been applied.
