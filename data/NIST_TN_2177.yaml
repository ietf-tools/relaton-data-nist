abstract:
- content: 'The Charpy Machine Verification Program at NIST in Boulder uses heat-treated
    4340 steel for the production of indirect verification Charpy specimens at low-
    and high-energy level. Recently, a batch of steel purchased for the program turned
    out to be unacceptably inhomogeneous, causing several NIST Contractors to produce
    specimen lots that did not fulfil our variability requirements, despite repeated
    attempts at modifying the heat-treatment process. The whole batch of steel had
    to be eventually scraped. In order to avoid such an occurrence in the future and
    develop an investigation procedure that can detect variability issues in the acceptance
    phase of newly purchased batches of 4340 steel, we have performed the following
    investigations and measurements on samples from good and bad heats: hardness measurements
    (Rockwell C and Vickers), instrumented Charpy tests, optical investigations, and
    texture analyses (including grain size measurements). Of all the parameters considered,
    we found that grain size can clearly differentiate between acceptable (30 m 40
    m) and unacceptable (60 m 70 m) heats, and should therefore become the basis of
    future heat quality assessments. In support, hardness measurements can also be
    performed, while Charpy tests are not recommended in view of their relative experimental
    and economic burden.'
