abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to provide information to organizations
    regarding the security capabilities of wireless communications using WiMAX networks
    and to provide recommendations on using these capabilities. WiMAX technology is
    a wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) technology based upon the IEEE 802.16
    standard. It is used for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to,
    fixed last-mile broadband access, long-range wireless backhaul, and access layer
    technology for mobile wireless subscribers operating on telecommunications networks.
