abstract:
- content: Buckling-Restrained Braced Frames (BRBFs) are one of the newer types of
    seismic force-resisting systems used in modern building designs. This Guide addresses
    the seismic design of steel BRBFs in typical building applications within regions
    of moderate to high seismic hazard, corresponding to Seismic Design Categories
    (SDC) C through F as defined in ASCE 7.This Guide was written to provide guidance
    to practicing structural engineers regarding the use of requirements in applicable
    codes and standards for the design of BRBF systems. The Guide is also useful to
    others seeking to understand the basis of, and to correctly implement, the appropriate
    code provisions related to BRBFs, including building officials, educators, researchers,
    and students.
