abstract:
- content: New smart grid architectures, devices, systems, and applications require
    extensive data exchange, necessitating well-defined interfaces to transfer and
    translate this data across the grid. Clarifying the protocols and data performance
    requirements across channels of communication is critical to easing the integration
    and interoperability of smart grid technologies. Testing and certification (T&C)
    programs provide a mechanism for all stakeholders to gain confidence that equipment
    will operate as intended and conforms to standards. The added confidence afforded
    by T&C strengthens the standards ecosystem and fosters technology innovation and
    adoption. Companies can also advertise that products or services conform with
    a recognized technical standard or specification. While T&C programs do exist
    for smart grid standards, they are currently limited in number and in general
    are focused on a subset of metrics that cannot in isolation guarantee interoperability.
    This report presents the results of a workshop co-hosted by NIST with the Smart
    Electric Power Alliance and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
    (IEEE) Standards Association in Washington, DC. The purpose was to explore underlying
    drivers for the current state of T&C programs for smart grid interoperability.
    The workshop also examined interoperability profiles for smart grid standards
    as a means to accelerate the development of T&C programs. Workshop attendees included
    nearly 50 experts from the smart grid stakeholder community, including representatives
    from industry, academia, government, professional associations, and testing and
    certification bodies.
