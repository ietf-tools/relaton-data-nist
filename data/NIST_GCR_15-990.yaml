abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to propose a recommended practice for the
    representation of schematic symbols and the integration of schematic symbols with
    functional and physical representations of packaged electronic component models
    in ISO 10303-210 (STEP AP 210). While the representation of AP 210 packages and
    packaged parts has been previously validated through existing implementations,
    the representation of component functional models and associated schematic symbols
    has been less thoroughly exercised. AP 210 has dedicated concepts for the representation
    of a functional element, as well as the association of a functional element with
    a physical realization through a packaged part and associated package model. The
    intent in the development of this recommended practice was to leverage existing
    draughting capabilities within the STEP standards for the presentation of a schematic
    symbol in AP 210. The schematic symbol is a presentation of the functional model
    for human visualization, interpretation, and manipulation - the schematic symbol
    should be a draughting representation of a functional element.
