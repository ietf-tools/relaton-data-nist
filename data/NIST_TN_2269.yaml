abstract:
- content: This report describes the development and validation of a computational
    modeling approach for steel gravity frames with composite floor systems subjected
    to fire exposure. A full-scale compartment fire test conducted on a two-story
    steel gravity frame structure with a composite concrete floor slab on steel decking
    was used in the validation process. The experiment was conducted under combined
    mechanical and fire loading in the National Fire Research Laboratory (NRFL) at
    the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). The intent of the experiment
    was to evaluate the influence of the slab reinforcement on the structural performance
    of the composite floor assembly, which incorporated deformed steel reinforcing
    bars in contrast with the welded wire reinforcement used in the previous test
    in the series. The objective of the computational investigation, summarized in
    this report, was to validate the adequacy of the computational modeling approach
    to capture the primary structural behaviors and failure modes observed during
    the fire test conducted in the NIST NFRL and to provide additional insights into
    the structural performance through detailed modeling of the system response. The
    computational model of the composite floor system was developed using the LS-DYNA
    finite element software and incorporated detailed modeling of the system components,
    including the lightweight reinforced concrete floor slab on profiled steel decking,
    primary and secondary steel beams and supporting columns, shear stud connectors,
    and bolted steel shear connections. The model adequately predicted the large deformations
    observed in the fire test of the composite floor assembly and captured their predominant
    deformation mechanisms, including lateral distortional buckling of the steel beams
    supporting the composite floor. Results from this study can further implementation
    of the performance-based design approaches for structural-fire safety in the U.S.
    and worldwide.
