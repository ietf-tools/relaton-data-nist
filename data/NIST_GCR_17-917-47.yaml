abstract:
- content: This Guide covers seismic design issues pertaining to precast concrete
    diaphragms with or without cast-in-place topping slabs. This Guide is written
    primarily for practicing structural engineers and should also be useful to architects,
    building regulators (building officials and plan checkers), and contractors. Students,
    educators, and others interested in understanding the basis for the common design
    methods used for precast concrete diaphragms will find this document a useful
    beginning step in expanding that understanding.
