abstract:
- content: In this report, high-Reynolds number turbulent flow around an axisymmetric
    hill is studied using large eddy and unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes
    simulations and the results are extensively validated against experiment. The
    boundary-layer thickness of the incoming flow is about half of the height of the
    hill. In the process, the dynamic Smagorinsky sub-grid scale eddy-viscosity model
    and a precursor forcing technique to match the experimental mean velocity profile
    is implemented in the computational toolbox for wind engineering, windOF which
    is based on the open source computational fluid dynamic solver OpenFOAM. The results
    show that the windOF is capable of producing reliable results with LES for this
    complex flow which includes complicated flow topography due to smooth-wall separation,
    lee-side separation, reattachment and recovery behind the hill, etc. However,
    URANS predictions demonstrate significant discrepancies in several flow features,
    specifically in the lee-side separation and recovery that are characteristic of
    the RANS models which only consider much smaller scale turbulence compared to
    the mean flow distortion scales relevant to this flow.
