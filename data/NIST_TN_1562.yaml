abstract:
- content: Small specimen test techniques become ever more popular as the need increases
    to characterize mechanical properties by use of the smallest possible amount of
    material, due to various restrictions on material availability, iiradiation, testing
    space, and other factors. NIST is cuiTcntly developing reference miniaturized
    Charpy V-notch (MCVN) specimens for the indirect verification of small-scale impact
    testing machines. The same materials used for NIST standard verification specimens
    are being evaluated at three energy levels (low, high and super-high). Two specimen
    types are being investigated, denominated KLST (from the German Kleinstprobe,
    or small specimen) and RHS (reduced half-size). Several instrumented impact tests
    on miniaturized KLST and RHS specimens of low, high and super-high energy have
    been performed and analyzed. The variability of MCVN data has been compared to
    that of full-size Chaipy data from the same lot of test specimens. Although this
    can be considered just the preliminary phase of this project, the results indicate
    that MCVN verification specimens can be used for the indirect verification of
    small-scale instmmented impact testers, both in terms of absorbed energy and maximum
    force. Additional aspects have also been investigated, such as the influence of
    shear lip symmetry and specimen fractui-e on absorbed energy and the coiTclation
    between miniaturized and full-size Chaipy data.
