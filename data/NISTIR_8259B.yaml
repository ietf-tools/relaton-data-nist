abstract:
- content: Non-technical supporting capabilities are actions a manufacturer or third-party
    organization performs in support of the cybersecurity of an IoT device. This publication
    defines an Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers non-technical supporting
    capability core baseline, which is a set of non-technical supporting capabilities
    generally needed from manufacturers or other third parties to support common cybersecurity
    controls that protect an organization s devices as well as device data, systems,
    and ecosystems. The purpose of this publication is to provide organizations a
    starting point to use in identifying the non-technical supporting capabilities
    needed in relation to IoT devices they will manufacture, integrate, or acquire.
    This publication is intended to be used in conjunction with NISTIR 8259, Foundational
    Cybersecurity Activities for IoT Device Manufacturers and NISTIR 8259A, IoT Device
    Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline.
