abstract:
- content: The NIST Dietary Supplement Laboratory Quality Assurance Program (DSQAP)
    was established in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
    Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2007 to enable members of the dietary supplements
    community to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance
    with various regulations including the dietary supplement current good manufacturing
    practices (cGMPs). Exercise L of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories
    to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (iodine), contaminants
    (lead and arsenic), water-soluble vitamins (biotin), fat-soluble vitamins (lutein
    and zeaxanthin), fatty acids (omega-3 and -6), and botanical marker compounds
    (chlorogenic acid, flavonoids, and naphthodianthrones) in foods and/or botanical
    dietary supplement ingredients and finished products.
