abstract:
- content: With the newly created Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN),
    the public safety community is in the process of supplementing the use of land
    mobile radios (LMR) to a technology ecosystem that will include a variety of new
    communication tools, including a range of broadband data sharing platforms. It
    is imperative to have a clear understanding of first responder needs, requirements,
    and contexts of use in order for successful deployment and adoption of new communication
    technology. This report is part of a multi-phase mixed methods project that is
    designed to provide an in-depth look at the population of first responders, along
    with their work environments, their tasks, and their communication needs, with
    particular focus on their technology problems. In the current project phase, a
    large-scale, online nationwide survey of first responders in 911/Dispatch, Emergency
    Medical Services (EMS), Fire Service, and Law Enforcement was conducted. This
    report details the survey methodology, including survey development and dissemination,
    and summarizes nationwide participant demographics. A total of 7 182 completed
    survey responses were received, with responses from all 50 states and the District
    of Columbia (D.C.). The survey sampling priorities were mirrored in the data,
    with good representation from the four public safety disciplines surveyed (911/Dispatch,
    EMS, Fire Service, and Law Enforcement), and a good mixture of responses from
    urban, suburban, and rural areas. Other demographic variables of interest,such
    as jurisdictional level, years of service, and age,also showed good variability,
    mapping well to national numbers. Such a largescale survey, with over 7 000 completed
    responses across the United States, represents a dataset of great relevance for
    the public safety community. This multi-phase, mixed methods project provides
    direct input from first responders about the communication technology used and
    needed by first responders.
