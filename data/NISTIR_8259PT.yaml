abstract:
- content: Internet of Things (IoT) devices often lack device cybersecurity capabilities
    their customers-- organizations and individuals--can use to help mitigate their
    cybersecurity risks. Manufacturers can help their customers by improving how securable
    the IoT devices they make are by providing necessary cybersecurity functionality
    and by providing customers with the cybersecurity-related information they need.
    This publication describes recommended activities related to cybersecurity that
    manufacturers should consider performing before their IoT devices are sold to
    customers. These foundational cybersecurity activities can help manufacturers
    lessen the cybersecurity-related efforts needed by customers, which in turn can
    reduce the prevalence and severity of IoT device compromises and the attacks performed
    using compromised devices.
