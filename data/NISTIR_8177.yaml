abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology has constructed a testbed
    to measure the performance impact of cybersecurity defenses on Industrial Control
    Systems (ICS). The testbed allows researchers to emulate real-world industrial
    manufacturing processes and their control systems without replicating an entire
    factory environment or its machinery. This report focuses on the Robotic Enclave
    of the testbed, which is comprised of two robotic arms that emulate a material
    handling application where parts are transported collaboratively through simulated
    sequential machining operations. Metrics, key performance indicators, and methodologies
    for the performance measurements on the manufacturing process and specific subsystems
    are described.
