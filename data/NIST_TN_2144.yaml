abstract:
- content: User Equipment (UE)-to-Network Relay functionality was introduced in Release
    13 of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)
    to extend and improve user connectivity using the sidelink (SL) channels. The
    UE-to-Network Relay signalling allows the establishment and maintenance of a direct
    connection between the relay UE and the remote UE. Different procedures and timers
    are linked to these processes. In this paper, we focus on describing and evaluating
    the PC5 Signalling Protocol performance through system-level simulations. We also
    propose recommended timer values to increase the probability of successfully establishing
    and maintaining the connection between a remote UE and a relay UE.
