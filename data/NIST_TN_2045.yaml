abstract:
- content: 'When designing a test to confirm that an artifact (e.g., a radiation detection
    system) meets a performance threshold where the artifact''s performance is estimated
    based on a binary response, the number of required observations is often an initial
    question. To determine the required sample size, two pieces of information are
    necessary: the performance threshold; and a statement of acceptable risk or required
    confidence. In this chapter, we provide guidance on developing a defensible and
    successful test through the informed selection of a performance threshold and
    statement of acceptable risk. Using the statistical hypothesis testing framework,
    we illustrate the meaning of risk and confidence from both the consumer and producer''s
    perspectives. We define the power of a test and demonstrate how an experimenter
    can use a power curve to balance the tradeoffs between test burden (costs) and
    producer risk (type II error) while satisfying the required confidence. We provide
    a sample size and acceptance criterion table to define a fixed sample test that
    will satisfy a variety of performance thresholds and levels of acceptable risk.
    We conclude with a general discussion of sequential sampling tests and provide
    important considerations and contrasts to their fixed sample counterparts.'
