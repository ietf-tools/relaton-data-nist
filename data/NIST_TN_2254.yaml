abstract:
- content: Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in computational mechanics and earthquake
    engineering. Sensitivity analysis of a model (either numerical or physical) aims
    at quantifying the relative importance of each input parameter, their potential
    interaction, and their effects on the model response. Sensitivity analysis has
    a long-term application in structural engineering more specifically on reinforced
    concrete RC structures. Many researchers benefited from the results of sensitivity
    analysis to reduce the uncertainty domain to those variables which are very important.
    This further helps in uncertainty quantification by accelerating the entire process.
    This state-of-the-art technical report provides a comprehensive review of classical
    sensitivity analysis techniques, followed by an in-depth review of all the related
    documents that implemented a full sensitivity analysis or partially adopted it
    for uncertainty quantification-related discussions. This review report on sensitivity
    analysis of reinforced concrete structures is a valuable contribution to the field
    of computational mechanics and earthquake engineering. This review highlights
    the importance of selecting an appropriate sensitivity analysis technique to achieve
    reliable results in structural analysis and design. By providing insights into
    the advantages and limitations of various sensitivity analysis techniques, this
    report can guide researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers in selecting
    the most appropriate technique for their specific applications. It is observed
    that the outcome of a sensitivity analysis depends heavily on the applied technique
    to perform the sensitivity assessment which eventually may cause a significant
    bias during the decision making. This report paves the road for better selection
    of a sensitivity analysis technique in problems related to structural and earthquake
    engineering. The findings of this review have significant implications for improving
    the accuracy and reliability of structural analysis, ultimately leading to safer
    and more resilient structures.
