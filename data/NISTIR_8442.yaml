abstract:
- content: On-road autonomous vehicles are expected to significantly influence key
    aspects of everyday life. However, these complex systems can pose a safety risk
    in the event of unexpected system performance. Therefore, NIST held the Standards
    and Performance Metrics for On-Road Autonomous Vehicles Workshop to solicit stakeholder
    feedback with respect to challenges and opportunities in developing standards
    and performance metrics for this complex interdisciplinary field. In addition,
    this workshop aimed to foster a community consisting of stakeholders from a variety
    of disciplines and domains in autonomous vehicles. This workshop was conducted
    virtually over 2 days (March 8th-9th, 2022) consisting of introductory remarks,
    panels, breakout sessions, and concluding remarks. This report is a summary of
    the technical topics discussed by participants during the workshop.
