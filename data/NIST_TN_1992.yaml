abstract:
- content: 'This study quantifies the impact of different ground motion selection
    methods on the seismic performance evaluation of steel special moment frames.
    Two methods are investigated: a "traditional" approach, herein referred to as
    the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) method, and a newer approach
    known as the Conditional Mean Spectrum (CMS) method. The PEER method selects ground
    motions using the Riskbased Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCER) as the target
    spectrum, while the CMS method uses the conditional mean spectrum that anchor
    to the MCER at multiple conditioning periods. Three special moment frames of 4-,
    8-, and 16-stories are designed in accordance with ASCE/SEI 7-10 to represent
    archetype steel frame buildings as found in regions of high seismicity. The seismic
    performance of these frames is assessed with the nonlinear dynamic procedure prescribed
    in ASCE/SEI 41-13, using ground motions selected and scaled in accordance with
    both methods. The performance of the buildings is evaluated at the Collapse Prevention
    (CP) performance level for a far-field site located in Los Angeles, CA. The CMS
    method results in lower mean and median response in terms of demand-to-capacity
    ratios in the reduced beam sections and column hinges. Ground motions selected
    and scaled using CMS result in a smaller dispersion of the output parameters in
    most of the beam and column elements, if the conditioning period that results
    in the highest mean demand-to-capacity ratio is the fundamental period, ??1. The
    results of this study show that the ground motion selection process can cause
    significant differences in structural response that may lead to different retrofitting
    decisions. These results provide motivation for engineers to consider the use
    of the CMS method as an alternative ground motions selection approach when assessing
    building performance.'
