abstract:
- content: The purpose of this report is to track domestic manufacturing activity
    and its supply chain in order to develop a quantitative depiction of U.S. manufacturing
    in the context of the domestic economy and global industry. This depiction provides
    change agents, such as public entities and trade groups that invest in advancing
    the current state of manufacturing, insight into the current state and recent
    trends in US manufacturing. The report further identifies areas of manufacturing
    that can have large impacts on costs. The US remains a major manufacturing nation;
    however, production and innovation is increasing rapidly in other countries. US
    manufacturing was significantly impacted by the previous recession and has not
    returned to pre-recession levels of production or employment. The US has advantages
    in technological prowess, innovation, productivity, and research and development;
    however, education was ranked low in two indices (i.e., IMD and World Economic
    Forum) and ranked high as being a problematic factor for doing business, which
    could negatively impact US advantages in the future. Institutions and institutional
    framework, which include crime, regulatory frameworks, country credit rating,
    and government spending among other things, was ranked low in two indices. A number
    of costs were identified as challenges to US manufacturing, including high labor
    costs. An input-output analysis of US manufacturing reveals that management is
    a significant cost along with a number of other non-production costs such as wholesale
    trade. The number of injuries and the injury rate in US manufacturing has a general
    downward trend, benefiting employees; however, manufacturing employee compensation
    has only grown slowly in recent years.
