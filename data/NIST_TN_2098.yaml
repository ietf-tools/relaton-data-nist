abstract:
- content: 'In this paper we present results that expand on the Afghan Girl study
    by Daugman using gray-scale photographs of 4 subjects taken every year for 40
    years: The Brown Sisters photographic project by Nicholas Nixon. We extracted
    iris images from the photographs and generated match scores using two commercial
    iris recognition algorithms. We developed criteria for making objective decisions
    about the utility of the extracted iris images and restricted the analysis of
    the mated pairs to those satisfying the criteria. The resulting match scores demonstrate
    matches at thresholds that correspond to FMR of 0.01 or better over periods of
    up to 9 years. These are the initial results; optimization of the process may
    improve the results. The Brown Sisters images used in this work are (c)Nicholas
    Nixon, and courtesy Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco.'
