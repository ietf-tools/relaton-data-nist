abstract:
- content: Selecting transmit volume levels using a transmit volume optimization (TVO)
    process is the first calibration step in performing quality of experience (QoE)
    measurements developed by the Mission Critical Voice portfolio of the Public Safety
    Communications Research (PSCR) Division. As noted in prior publications, audio
    volume levels have an impact on output consistency while performing mission critical
    voice (MCV) QoE measurements with push-to-talk (PTT) communications devices. These
    measurements must be consistent, repeatable, and comparable. The goal of this
    project is to ensure that MCV measurements are consistent and repeatable; it specifically
    focuses on transmit volume levels and their impact on the system under test (SUT).
    To achieve this, a measurement that characterizes audio distortion levels, specifically
    caused by overdriven speech into a transmit device, was developed. This measurement
    is performed across a series of transmit volume levels. The results are then used
    to present the system user with optimal levels to ensure MCV measurements contain
    a minimal amount of uncertainty caused by distortion within a range of stable
    volume levels. This paper will discuss the development of this specific distortion
    measurement and the methods designed to find optimal transmit volume levels.
