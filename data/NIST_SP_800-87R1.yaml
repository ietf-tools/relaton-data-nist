abstract:
- content: The Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12 called for new standards
    to be adopted governing the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow
    physical and logical access to Federal government locations and systems. The Personal
    Identity Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors, (Federal Information
    Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201)) was developed to establish standards for identity
    credentials. This document, Special Publication 800-87 (SP 800-87), provides the
    organizational codes necessary to establish the PIV Federal Agency Smart Credential
    Number (PIV FASC-N) that is required to be included in the FIPS 201 Card Holder
    Unique Identifier (CHUID) and is a companion document to FIPS 201.
