abstract:
- content: Mobile devices provide access to vital workplace resources while giving
    employees the flexibility to perform their daily activities. Securing these devices
    is essential to the continuity of business operations. While mobile devices can
    increase efficiency and productivity, they can also leave sensitive data vulnerable.
    Mobile device management tools can address such vulnerabilities by helping secure
    access to networks and resources. These tools are different from those required
    to secure the typical computer workstation. This practice guide focuses on security
    enhancements that can be made to corporate-owned personally-enabled (COPE) mobile
    devices. COPE devices are owned by an enterprise and issued to an employee. Both
    the enterprise and the employee can install applications onto the device. To address
    the challenge of securing COPE mobile devices while managing risks, the NCCoE
    at NIST built a reference architecture to show how various mobile security technologies
    can be integrated within an enterprise s network. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice
    Guide demonstrates how organizations can use standards-based, commercially available
    products to help meet their mobile device security and privacy needs.
