abstract:
- content: 'The 2018 National Institute of Standards and Technology Environmental
    Scan provide an analysis of the external factors that can influence NIST and the
    fulfillment of its mission as the agency looks to create a strategic plan for
    the coming years. The analysis was conducted through four separate lenses: Societal,
    Political, Geopolitical, and Technological. Observations highlighted range for
    the unique political climate NIST currently faces to challenges to NIST''s leadership
    in metrology to the new opportunities provided new breakthrough technology innovations.
    Interfaced together, this scan aims to provide a wholistic view of the environment
    NIST faces moving forward.'
