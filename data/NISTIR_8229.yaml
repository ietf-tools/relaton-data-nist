abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the
    Community Resilience Planning Guide for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems (NIST
    SP 1190) in October 2015. The Guide describes a six-step process to develop a
    community resilience plan. The Guide was intended to be flexible, so that it could
    be used to create a standalone plan or to complement other planning processes
    by integrating resilience measures into long-term plans. Since the Guide?s release,
    several communities have begun to use the Guide to develop resilience plans. This
    report documents three of those early applications. The three applications, Fort
    Collins, Colorado, Delaware Department of Transportation, and Howard County, MD,
    offer three different approaches to the use of the Guide and demonstrate its flexibility.
