abstract:
- content: This report summarizes the results of the FATE Quality Vector assessment
    track, which tests face image quality algorithmsâ€™ ability to detect specific defects
    such as non-frontal pose and background non-uniformity in the context of facial
    images. All algorithms submitted have some success at measuring various quality-related
    parameters.
