abstract:
- content: This publication describes the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education
    (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NICE Framework), a reference structure
    that describes the interdisciplinary nature of the cybersecurity work. It serves
    as a fundamental reference resource for describing and sharing information about
    cybersecurity work and the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed to complete
    tasks that can strengthen the cybersecurity posture of an organization. As a common,
    consistent lexicon that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work, the NICE
    Framework improves communication about how to identify, recruit, develop, and
    retain cybersecurity talent. The NICE Framework is a reference source from which
    organizations or sectors can develop additional publications or tools that meet
    their needs to define or provide guidance on different aspects of cybersecurity
    workforce development, planning, training, and education.
