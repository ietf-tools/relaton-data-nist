abstract:
- content: Cloud computing can and does mean different things to different people.
    The common characteristics most interpretations share are on-demand scalability
    of highly available and reliable pooled computing resources, secure access to
    metered services from nearly anywhere, and displacement of data and services from
    inside to outside the organization. While aspects of these characteristics have
    been realized to a certain extent, cloud computing remains a work in progress.
    This publication provides an overview of the security and privacy challenges pertinent
    to public cloud computing and points out considerations organizations should take
    when outsourcing data, applications, and infrastructure to a public cloud environment.
