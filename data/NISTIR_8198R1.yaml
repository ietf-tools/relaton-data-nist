abstract:
- content: Accurate knowledge of an object's location is essential in automated robotic
    applications such as machine tending, pick-and-place operations, and part assembly.
    Perception systems are used to acquire the object's location, and this information
    is then passed on to the robot. However, the measured location of the object is
    in the coordinate frame of the perception system. For the robot to act on the
    object, the location of the object must be transformed relative to the coordinate
    frame of the robot. In manufacturing applications that involve industrial robots,
    a common way to register coordinate frames to each other or to a global frame
    is by rigid-body, point-based registration using at least three common points
    or fiducials that are measured in both frames. Researchers at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a method to improve this registration
    method. The new method restores the rigid-body condition (RRBC). This report presents
    an assessment of the NIST RRBC method by conducting practical robotic peg-in-hole
    experiments. In these experiments, a robot arm was used to insert a peg into a
    hole. A simple Pass/Fail metric was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
    method. Two other metrics involving registration errors were also used. The results
    show that the RRBC reduces the number of failed insertions, especially with tight
    tolerances.
