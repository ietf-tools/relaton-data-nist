abstract:
- content: With an artificial example of a 2D nonlinear advection diffusion equation
    on the unit square this paper considers the data assimilation problem of finding
    initial values that can evolve into a close approximation to a desired target
    result at some realistic T > 0. Highly non smooth target data are considered,
    that may not correspond to actual solutions at time T, and it may not be possible
    to find such initial values. The aim is to illustrate the inherent difficulties
    of the ill-posed data assimilation problem.
