abstract:
- content: Since 1984, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
    coordinated what is now known as the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance
    Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids
    in human serum and plasma. The MMQAP has provided participants with measurement
    comparability assessment through use of interlaboratory studies, Standard Reference
    Materials (SRMs) and control materials, methods development and validation, workshops,
    and tutorials. This report reproduces the printed materials provided to participants
    in the 1997 Fat-Soluble Vitamin and Carotenoid Analysis Tutorials, the most recent
    in a series of hands-on training programs for laboratorians involved in fat-soluble
    vitamin-related analytes. Some of the tutorial material has been updated.
