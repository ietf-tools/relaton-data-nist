abstract:
- content: This publication specifies the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA),
    including its primary component cryptographic engine, the Data Encryption Algorithm
    (DEA). When implemented in an SP 800-38-series-compliant mode of operation and
    in a FIPS 140-2-compliant cryptographic module, TDEA may be used by Federal organizations
    to protect sensitive unclassified data. Protection of data during transmission
    or while in storage may be necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity
    of the information represented by the data. This Recommendation defines the mathematical
    steps required to cryptographically protect data using TDEA and to subsequently
    process such protected data. TDEA is made available for use by Federal agencies
    within the context of a total security program consisting of physical security
    procedures, good information management practices, and computer system/network
    access controls.
