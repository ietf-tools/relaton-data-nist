abstract:
- content: This guide describes the test setups and processes needed to perform standards-based
    testing of radiological and nuclear detection systems. This guide is intended
    to reduce the potential for misinterpretation of performance requirements, test
    methods, and to improve uniformity of testing methods used at different testing
    organizations. This guide does not address safety concerns, if any, associated
    with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this guide to establish
    appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory
    limitations prior to use.
