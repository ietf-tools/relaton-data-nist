abstract:
- content: NIST is committed to the idea that results of federally funded research
    are a valuable national resource and a strategic asset. To the extent feasible
    and consistent with law, agency mission, resource constraints, and U.S. national,
    homeland, and economic security, NIST will promote the deposit of scientific data
    arising from unclassified research and programs, funded wholly or in part by NIST,
    except for Standard Reference Data, free of charge in publicly accessible databases.
    Subject to the same conditions and constraints listed above, NIST also intends
    to make freely available to the public, in publicly accessible repositories, all
    peer-reviewed scholarly publications arising from unclassified research and programs
    funded wholly or in part by NIST. This Special Publication represents the work
    of Engineering Laboratory researchers at professional conferences, as reported
    in Fiscal Year 2017. More information on public access to NIST research is available
    at https://www.nist.gov/open.
