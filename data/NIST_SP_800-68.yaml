abstract:
- content: NIST Special Publication 800-68 has been created to assist IT professionals,
    in particularly Windows XP system administrators and information security personnel,
    in effectively securing Windows XP systems. It discusses Windows XP and various
    application security settings in technical detail. The guide provides insight
    into the threats and security controls that are relevant for various operational
    environments, such as for a large enterprise or a home office. It describes the
    need to document, implement, and test security controls, as well as to monitor
    and maintain systems on an ongoing basis. It presents an overview of the security
    components offered by Windows XP and provides guidance on installing, backing
    up, and patching Windows XP systems. It discusses security policy configuration,
    provides an overview of the settings in the accompanying NIST security templates,
    and discusses how to apply additional security settings that are not included
    in the NIST security templates. It demonstrates securing popular office productivity
    applications, Web browsers, e-mail clients, personal firewalls, antivirus software,
    and spyware detection and removal utilities on Windows XP systems to provide protection
    against viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other types of malicious code. This
    list is not intended to be a complete list of applications to install on Windows
    XP system, nor does it imply NIST's endorsement of particular commercial off-the-shelf
    (COTS) products.
