abstract:
- content: This report presents detailed and reduced-order finite element modeling
    of heat transfer in composite floor slabs with profiled steel decking. The detailed
    modeling approach uses solid elements for the concrete slab and shell elements
    for the steel decking. The reduced-order modeling approach represents the thick
    and thin parts of a composite slab with alternating strips of layered shell elements.
    In the reduced-order modeling approach, a linear gradient in the density of concrete
    in the rib is used to represent the tapered profile of the rib. In order to more
    accurately account for the heat input through web of the steel decking in the
    reduced-order models, the specific heat of concrete in the rib is modified and
    a dummy material with low specific heat and high thermal conductivity is added
    in the thin part of the slab. The detailed modeling approach is validated against
    experimental results available in the literature, and the reduced-order modeling
    approach is calibrated against the detailed model results and validated against
    experimental data. A parametric study using the detailed modeling approach is
    carried out to investigate the influence of the thermal boundary conditions, thermal
    properties of materials, and slab geometry on the temperature distribution in
    the composite slab. The results show that the rib height of the decking and the
    width at the top of the rib are key factors governing the temperature distribution
    in the rib. In addition, a mesh-sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate
    the extent to which the mesh size could be increased while maintaining sufficient
    accuracy.
