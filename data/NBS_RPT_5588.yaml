abstract:
- content: 'In recent years there has been an increased utilization of meteoro¿̐¿
    logical information for the prediction of radio field strengths at fre¿̐¿ quencies
    of 50 Me. and above. Various studies have used radiosonde measurements to describe
    the effect of elevated superrefractive layers _1/_, the gross gradient in the
    first kilometer of the earth''s atmosphere _2,_3/_, and, more recently, it has
    been shown that the long term mean value of the radio transmission loss may be
    represented as a linear function of the surface value of the radio refractivity
    as derived from surface weather observations. The refractivity, Ns is given by
    _8/_: N = (n - 1) 10^6 = 77.6/T [ Ps + 4810 es RH/T ] where P is the station pressure
    in millibars, RH is the percent of the saturation vapor pressure, es , in millibars
    at the absolute temperatures T, in degrees Kelvin, and n is the refractive index.
    The data used in the present study were obtained from the Kopenhagener Schluessel
    deck of the punched card library of the National Weather Records Center, U. S.
    Weather Bureau. The location of the weather stations used in this study are shown
    on Fig. 1, and are specified in more detail in Table I. The choice of stations
    was made so as to give detailed geographic coverage for the arbitrarily chosen
    two year period.'
