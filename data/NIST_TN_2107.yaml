abstract:
- content: Proper exoskeleton fit to user impacts the safety of the human robot interaction.
    Exoskeletons are now being marketed by several manufacturers and yet there are
    currently no defined methods to measure the exoskeleton fit to the user. This
    research aims to develop a quantifiable test and measurement framework for evaluating
    exoskeleton performance, beginning with the tracking of knee kinematics. Key challenges
    in knee kinematic measurements include the complexity of human biomechanics, the
    variability of human anthropometry as well as the uncertainty of marker position,
    relative to underlying skeletal features, as computed by an optical tracking system
    (OTS). A measurement methodology to assess exoskeleton-to-leg fit based on comparison
    of knee kinematics between the human and the exoskeleton is proposed. The methodology
    is based on the use of rigid artifacts to minimize marker motion, and therefore
    measurement error. Separate artifacts for the exoskeleton and the human limbs
    enable independent tracking of exoskeleton and knee joint kinematics in order
    to assess exoskeleton fit to user. A prosthetic test apparatus and a 3D printed
    human knee model apparatus were also designed and developed to simulate the biomechanics
    of the human knee. The experimental data from the prosthetic leg test apparatus
    showed agreement with both the simulated analytical model and the ground truth
    skeletal structure relative to the artifacts placed on the simulated leg. The
    reconfigurable artifact was also tested by the researchers to demonstrate how
    the novel design can be used to track knee kinematics between the human leg and
    the exoskeleton leg.
