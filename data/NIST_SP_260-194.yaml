abstract:
- content: Rotational rheometers are commonly used to measure a material's rheological
    properties such as viscosity and yield stress [1]. Manufacturers of rheometers
    generally recommend the use of a standard oil of known viscosity to calibrate
    the instrument in order to ensure it's proper operation. These oils are Newtonian
    fluids and are not representative of the flow of concrete, mortar or paste which
    behave as a Bingham, Hershel-Bulkley, or power-law fluid. Also, oils are expensive,
    and would be cost prohibitive because large volumes of the reference material
    would be needed to calibrate concrete rheometers. Therefore, a relatively inexpensive,
    well characterized reference material, with properties similar to concrete, (e.g.,
    non-Newtonian and contains aggregates similar in dimension to that in concrete
    for testing in concrete rheometers) is needed. The purpose of this report is to
    describe the process used to create and certify a new Standard Reference Material,
    SRM 2497, a "Standard Reference Concrete for Rheological Measurements". The development
    of this new Standard Reference Material (SRM) is based on a three-step-multi-scale
    approach. The first step was to develop a paste rheology reference material (SRM2492)
    [2], the second step involved creating a mortar rheology reference material, SRM2493
    [3]. The final step, described in this work, is development of a concrete rheology
    reference material, SRM 2497. All measurements used for the development of SRM
    2497 are provided along with statistical analyses. A brief description, along
    with references, of the computational model that was utilized to predict the behavior
    of the SRM is also provided. The data analyzed in this study serves to certify
    that the proposed models and values are validated with proper quantification of
    uncertainty.
