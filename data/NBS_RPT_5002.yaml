abstract:
- content: The reflection from a wire grid parallel to a plane interface is considered.
    The respective media are homogeneous and either or both can be dissipative. The
    grid is composed of thin equi-spaced wires of finite conductivity. The plane wave
    solution for arbitrary incidence is then generalized for cylindrical-wave excitation.
    The energy absorbed from a magnetic line source by a grid situated on the surface
    of a dissipative half-space is treated in some detail. This latter problem is
    a two-dimensional analogy of a vertical antenna with a radial wire ground system.
