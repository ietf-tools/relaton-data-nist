abstract:
- content: An analysis was performed to provide design guidance on the cooling of
    an NIST-developed in situ fire visualization device, called Burn Observation Bubble
    (BOB). The analysis was to address the question of how long the device can be
    operated in a fire without being damaged by the fire. The analysis included single-pass
    and recirculating cooling systems. The resulting design equations depend only
    on the fire scenario, cooling water flow rate, and the volume ratio of the device
    to recirculating cooling water reservoir. In the limit of infinite recirculating
    cooling water reservoir, the design equations reduce to those of a single-pass
    system. Sample calculations were given to illustrate the applicability of the
    equations.
