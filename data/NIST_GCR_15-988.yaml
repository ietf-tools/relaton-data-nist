abstract:
- content: 'Industrial users of ISO 10303 (STEP) protocols need the ability to exchange
    design product data that is in conformance with recently updated ISO Geometric
    Product Specifications (GPS) ISO 1101:2012; with AWS A2.4:2012 Standard Symbols
    for Welding, Brazing, and Nondestructive Examination; with ISO 2553: 2013 Welding
    and allied processes -- Symbolic representation on drawings -- Welded joints;
    with SAE AS8879D and ISO 3161:1999 Aerospace -- UNJ threads -- General requirements
    and limit dimensions; with and ISO 5855-1:1999 -- Aerospace -- MJ threads -- Part
    1: General requirements. The LOTAR consortium created a project to extend ISO
    10303-242 for these new capabilities. Changes to relevant STEP information models
    have been proposed to support the additions to ISO 1101, and new information models
    proposed to support the welding and thread standards.'
