abstract:
- content: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 201-2, 'Personal
    Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors,' establishes
    a standard for a PIV system based on secure and reliable forms of identity credentials
    issued by the federal government to its employees and contractors. These credentials
    are intended to authenticate individuals to federally controlled facilities, information
    systems, and applications as part of access management. With the emergence of
    computing devices, such as tablets, hybrid computers, and, in particular, mobile
    devices, the use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Cards has proved to be
    challenging. To extend the value of PIV systems into mobile devices that do not
    have PIV Card readers, NIST developed technical guidelines on the implementation
    and life cycle of identity credentials that are issued by federal departments
    and agencies to individuals who possess and prove control over a valid PIV Card.
    These NIST guidelines, published in 2014, describe Derived PIV Credentials (DPCs)
    that leverage identity proofing and vetting results of current and valid PIV credentials.
    To demonstrate the DPC guidelines, the NCCoE at NIST built two security architectures
    by using commercial technology to enable the issuance of a Derived PIV Credential
    to mobile devices that use Federal Identity Credentialing and Access Management
    shared services. One option uses a software-only solution while the other leverages
    hardware built into many computing devices used today. This project resulted in
    a freely available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide that demonstrates how an
    organization can continue to provide multifactor authentication for users with
    a mobile device that leverages the strengths of the PIV standard. Although this
    project is aimed primarily at the federal sector's needs, it is also relevant
    to mobile device users with smart- card-based credentials in the private sector.
