abstract:
- content: Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing technology
    that uses a laser to selectively melt powder feedstock to build parts in a layer-by-layer
    process. For metals-based LBPF additive manufacturing, the interaction of the
    laser and powder feedstock creates byproducts such as a plume, spatter, and powder
    ejecta. Directional gas flow, typically nitrogen or argon, is used to remove or
    mitigate the negative effects of these byproducts. This report documents and presents
    gas flow measurements using hot-wire anemometers (HWA) for two different nozzles
    on a commercial LPBF machine and two different gasses at the NIST Additive Manufacturing
    Metrology Testbed (AMMT). The AMMT gas flow system generates comparable volumetric
    flow rates with argon and with nitrogen, which result in comparable flow speed
    profiles for both gasses. There are significant differences in the gas speed profiles
    along the gas flow direction (Y-position) and minimal differences perpendicular
    to the gas flow direction (X-position) with both machines. The speed differences
    with Y-position are in part due to the elevated inlet and outlet nozzles from
    the build platform. The average speed only decreases slightly from the inlet to
    the outlet despite these differences in the speed profiles. The grid nozzle on
    the commercial machine with a downward facing row of channels at the base of the
    nozzle increases the gas speed close to the build platform; however, non-uniform
    speed profiles remain. Gas speed and therefore gas speed measurements with HWAs
    are highly dependent on Z and Y position. This should be considered when prescribing
    machine performance protocols. Additional suggestions for measuring and reporting
    gas flow are made as well as recommended future experiments and simulations to
    assist in machine performance standards.
