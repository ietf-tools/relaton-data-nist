abstract:
- content: The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), in collaboration with
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology, hosted a Workshop on Advanced
    Monitoring, Diagnostic, and Prognostic Technologies at the conclusion of the ASME
    Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) on June 8th and 9th, 2017,
    on the campus of University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California.
    The purpose of the workshop was to bring together key subject matter experts to
    identify manufacturing needs and wants with respect to advanced monitoring, diagnostic,
    and prognostic technologies (collectively known as prognostics and health management
    (PHM)), along with ways of verifying and validating their performance to enhance
    maintenance and control strategies within manufacturing operations at the factory?floor.
    This report documents this two-day event which summarizes presentations and brainstorming
    sessions in addition to detailing the key topic area discussions. The findings
    in this document are expected to provide a foundation for which a future ASME
    standards effort will be built. Likewise, the next steps in this effort are detailed
    towards the end of this document including two follow-up events that will further
    articulate key topic areas of focus.
