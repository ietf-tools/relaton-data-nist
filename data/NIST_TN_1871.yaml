abstract:
- content: A workshop was held at NIST Gaithersburg on October 27 and 28, 2014 to
    discuss the exothermic reaction of halogenated hydrocarbons. The industries that
    gathered to discuss the topic were the fire suppression, fire suppression in aircraft,
    and Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration industries. In the
    former, the compounds of interest are used as fire suppressants, and in the latter,
    as working fluids for vapor compression heating/cooling equipment. The purpose
    of the workshop was to identify the important parameters controlling the flammability
    of the compounds, and identify research needs for overcoming the obstacles to
    their safe and effective use.
