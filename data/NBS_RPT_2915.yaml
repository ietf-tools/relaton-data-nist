abstract:
- content: At frequencies above 50 Me climate, meteorological conditions in the troposphere,
    and the shape of terrain irregularities play the principal roles in determining
    the strength and distance that a signal will be propagated. A catalog of tropospheric
    propagation radio field strength data covering approximately 200 propagation paths
    for distances from 33 to 61 6 miles and frequencies from 41 to 1046 Me is presented
    in order to disseminate the information available at the National Bureau of Standards.
