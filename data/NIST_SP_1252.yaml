abstract:
- content: 'This companion report summarizes the discussion and subsequent actions
    from a supplementary one-day session following the NIST Food Safety Workshop held
    in October 2019. The supplementary session was open to National Metrology Institutes
    (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs), commercial reference material and reference
    standard producers, and NIST staff engaged in developing measurement services
    and standards for food safety. The main goals of the session were to synthesize
    the key takeaways obtained from discussions during the 3-day Food Safety Workshop
    focused on four main food safety pillars (microbiological contaminants, chemical
    contaminants, food allergens, and authenticity); disseminate the unique challenges,
    capabilities, and interests for each institute and organization; and then develop
    cooperative solutions in five specific global food safety challenge areas, as
    delineated from the four pillars: microbiological contaminants, allergens and
    authenticity, inorganic contaminants, pesticides residues, and non-pesticide organic
    contaminants.'
