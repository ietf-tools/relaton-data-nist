abstract:
- content: 'The Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) is being developed
    to provide a dedicated network for the use of first responders during incident
    response. A wave of new communication technologies compatible with the NPSBN is
    on the horizon, as major research and development efforts continue for these technologies.
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology''s (NIST) Public Safety Communications
    Research (PSCR) Usability Team investigated the contexts in which first responders
    work, their experiences with incident response, and their problems with and needs
    for communication technology. The team conducted an exploratory, sequential, mixed-methods
    study to gather insights into the experiences and needs of first responders. The
    multi-phase study included in-depth interviews with 193 first responders in Phase
    1, followed by a nationwide survey of 7 182 first responders in Phase 2. This
    report is the tenth volume published from this data and provides a holistic understanding
    of the usability of communication technology for first responders. It is unique
    in that it combines results from both Phase 1 and Phase 2 providing an integrated
    analysis of both the qualitative and quantitative data. This integration allowed
    us to develop overarching themes about the problems and needs of first responders,
    focusing specifically on the barriers and facilitators to the adoption and use
    of communication technology. In this report, we discuss how adoption and use of
    communication technology is impacted by first responders'' experiences across
    three themes: technology trustworthiness, user autonomy, and frustration. Overarchingly,
    there is a lack of technology trustworthiness combined with low autonomy that
    often results in frustration for first responders. The development of trustworthy
    technology takes time and relies on first responders knowing that their input
    and experiences matter (i.e., having autonomy). The lack of trustworthiness and
    autonomy has an impact on the acceptance and adoption of new technology and the
    ability of first responders to accomplish their primary tasks. This work can be
    useful for the researchers, designers, and developers (R&D) community as it works
    to improve current and develop future communication technology for first responders.
    It can also aid administrators and decision makers (ADMs) in making purchasing
    decisions and developing policies related to communication technology for first
    responders in their departments.'
