abstract:
- content: Non-targeted analysis is the determination of the chemical composition
    of a complex mixture without a priori knowledge regarding the identities or quantities
    of the compound. These techniques can be performed in a wide variety of materials
    and areas of study. Methods and results between laboratories can vary widely based
    on the compounds of interest and user expertise, which can cause poor interlaboratory
    comparability of non-targeted results. To address this knowledge gap, three research
    grade test materials were developed to allow for the comparison of instrument
    methods, specifically reversed-phase liquid chromatography with positive electrospray
    ionization mass spectrometry. The materials were shipped to thirty-one participating
    laboratories to be analyzed by their own non-targeted analysis instrumental method.
    Of the participants, twenty-three laboratories submitted good quality datasets
    and could be further evaluated. Using principal components analysis, the differences
    and similarities of the analytical methods could be examined. Overall, there were
    no obvious trends or associations between the methods of different laboratories
    and the review of the principal components analysis revealed no notable parameters
    that caused significant clustering or separation.
