abstract:
- content: Instrument performance is evaluated through performing a set of tests,
    and the test results determine whether the instrument meets or fails the standard
    requirements. The performance test data are analyzed and usually point estimate
    and confidence bounds are calculated, on which a testing decision is made. This
    chapter provides recipes of statistical analysis of the test data, including estimation
    of probability of detection or identification, or false alarm rate, and particularly
    on how various confidence intervals and confidence bounds are computed based on
    sound statistical principles.
