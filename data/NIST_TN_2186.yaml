abstract:
- content: Public safety practitioners performing day-to-day activities and responding
    to incidents communicate in ways that are very different from the general public.
    In order to determine if a particular technology or network deployment can meet
    the performance requirements critical to first responders, sound and detailed
    scenarios are needed. In this document, we present a fictional school shooting
    scenario involving a large number of responders, vehicles, and applications, over
    a 4-hour period. We describe, in detail, the location of the users, the type of
    applications used and their usage patterns. We also present a basic net-work deployment
    using Long Term Evolution (LTE) and describe the implementation of such a scenario
    in the open-source ns-3 simulation platform so it can serve as a baseline for
    future research.
