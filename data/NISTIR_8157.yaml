abstract:
- content: Long-Term Evolution (LTE) supporting Device-to-Device (D2D) communication
    is a feature introduced in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) release 12.
    D2D communication is critical in public safety applications, which enables communication
    among first responders when the network infrastructure may not be available. In
    order to characterize the performance of D2D communications using network simulation
    tool (e.g. ns-3), accurate physical layer error model is important. In this document,
    we present our D2D physical channel simulations to study the BLock Error Rate
    (BLER) performance of the physical channels. We also demonstrate how to integrate
    the simulation results into network simulator to perform system level simulation.
