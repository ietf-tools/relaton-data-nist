abstract:
- content: The Return on Investment (ROI) Initiative for Unleashing American Innovation
    is part of a national conversation that is designed to advance the Lab-to-Market
    cross agency priority (CAP) goal of the President's Management Agenda (PMA). The
    ROI Initiative's goal is to maximize the transfer of Federal investments in science
    and technology into value for America in ways that will (a) meet current and future
    economic and national security needs in a rapidly shifting technology marketplace
    and enhance U.S. competitiveness globally, and (b) attract greater private sector
    investment to create innovative products, processes, and services, as well as
    new businesses and industries. The PMA's Lab-to-Market CAP Goal is co-led by the
    U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) via the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
    (OSTP). By statute, DOC is the lead Federal agency for technology transfer policy
    and practice. As part of the ROI Initiative, NIST implemented an open, inclusive,
    and collaborative process to identify and assess options for supporting the ROI
    Initiative's overall goal and objectives. This Green Paper is a discussion document
    based on an assessment of the feedback from the U.S. stakeholder community. It
    provides an initial summary of key stakeholder inputs and identifies short-term
    and long-term actions to modernize the U.S. system of technology transfer and
    innovation for the 21st century. Implementation of any of the intended actions
    that require specific policy, legislative, and/or regulatory actions will be advanced
    via formal proposals subject to appropriate interagency review, and public comment.
    The intended actions are designed to remove barriers to innovation, modernize
    partnering models and tools, expand entrepreneurial ecosystems, and create increased
    opportunities for returns to the American people from investment in R&D.
