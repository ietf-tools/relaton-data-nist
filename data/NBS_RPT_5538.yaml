abstract:
- content: Measurements of the horizontally and vertically polarized field components
    of VHF transmissions were performed within the urban areas of Muenster (Westphalia)
    and Hamburg, and the spatial distribution of the ratio of the field components
    determined. Vertically and horizontally polarized fields obtain cross-polarized
    components by reflections. The relative intensity of these components depends
    on the number, size, shape, and composition of the reflecting obstacles. For instance,
    for vertically polarized transmissions, the ratio of the vertically polarized
    to the horizontally polarized measured field component is infinite over absolutely
    flat terrain; however, this ratio may become less than unity if measured in the
    narrow canyons of a large city. In order to obtain estimates of the spatial distribution
    of this ratio, two series of measurements were performed during which the received
    field strength was measured simultaneously on the same spot with a vertical and
    a horizontal antenna. The results were evaluated by use of statistical analysis.
