abstract:
- content: 'On September 17, 2020, NIST hosted a virtual workshop to launch the Rapid
    Microbial Testing Methods (RMTM) Consortium. The RMTM Consortium aims to address
    the need for measurements and standards to increase confidence in the use of rapid
    testing for microbial contaminants in regenerative medicine and advanced therapy
    products. The purpose of the workshop was to publicize the launch of the Consortium,
    recruit new members, and obtain feedback from stakeholders on both the challenges
    with respect to applying RMTMs and potential solutions that the Consortium could
    provide. Over 250 attendees from industry, government, academia, and other organizations
    participated in the workshop. Invited speakers and panelists provided stimulus
    for discussion, and feedback from the stakeholders was obtained via question submission
    and polling. This report summarizes the presentations, discussions, and poll results
    from the workshop. Overall, the stakeholders supported the three proposed topic
    areas for the Consortium: reference materials, testing methods, and interlaboratory
    studies. Based on input from the workshop and poll, the proposed scope of the
    reference materials topic was expanded to consider DNA and other reference materials,
    in addition to whole cell materials. Likewise, the testing methods scope was increased
    to encompass validation schema as well as the test methodologies. As a next step,
    the Consortium began monthly meetings in November 2020, for members to discuss
    and finalize the scope and proposed working groups for the Consortium. It is expected
    that the Consortium will lead to measurement assurance solutions and improved
    approaches for the community to develop, validate, and implement RMTMs.'
