abstract:
- content: The introduction of cigarette ignition propensity standards has led to
    a reduction in the availability of high ignition propensity commercial cigarettes.
    Since high ignition propensity cigarettes are needed for soft furnishing flammability
    tests, a standard reference cigarette, SRM 1196, was developed. The current supply
    of SRM 1196 cigarettes is limited, and so the feasibility of a surrogate ignition
    source was examined. The surrogate ignition source should be repeatable, sustainable,
    relatively inexpensive, and should have a similar ignition propensity to the SRM
    1196 cigarette on a broad range of substrates. A literature review identified
    several potential surrogate ignition sources including cartridge heaters, hot
    slugs, and materials that can smolder, such as charcoal, cotton plugs, and cotton
    rope. Experiments quantified the heat transfer characteristics and ignition propensity
    of the SRM 1196 cigarette as a baseline for evaluating candidate ignition sources.
    In particular, thermocouples were used to measure the temperatures at the interface
    of the cigarette and the substrate for both reactive and inert substrates. Screening
    experiments were performed to estimate the ignition propensities of the candidate
    surrogate sources. Analysis of and experiments with these sources found that cartridge
    heaters are impractical for routine testing and that commercial versions of the
    combustible materials do not show appropriate or repeatable values of ignition
    propensity. The use of hot slugs would require additional testing in which the
    materials, dimensions, shape, and mass were all systematically varied. Extensive
    testing to identify fabrics which, when supported on a foam slab, would lead to
    some, but not 100 % ignitions did not find enough fabrics to demonstrate equivalence
    to the SRM 1196 cigarette. Because of the unlikelihood of success, it is recommended
    that these tests not be performed and that the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) order another supply of SRM 1196 cigarettes.
