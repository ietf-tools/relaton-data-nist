abstract:
- content: In light of an increasing number of cybersecurity events, organizations
    can improve resilience by ensuring that their risk management processes include
    comprehensive recovery planning. Identifying and prioritizing organization resources
    helps to guide effective plans and realistic test scenarios. This preparation
    enables rapid recovery from incidents when they occur and helps to minimize the
    impact on the organization and its constituents. Additionally, continually improving
    recovery planning by learning lessons from past events, including those of other
    organizations, helps to ensure the continuity of important mission functions.
    This publication provides tactical and strategic guidance regarding the planning,
    playbook developing, testing, and improvement of recovery planning. It also provides
    an example scenario that demonstrates guidance and informative metrics that may
    be helpful for improving resilience of information systems.
