abstract:
- content: There is currently no common data format for ballot styles and associated
    use-cases. This white paper investigates this and other potential interoperability
    gaps within the voting system in a holistic manner, by considering previous voting
    interoperability work and how it fits within thirteen key functions of a voting
    system. Gap analysis is performed by identifying data flows that cross functions,
    functions that might cross component boundaries and thus may significantly benefit
    from common data interfaces. Each data flow identified as significant for interoperability
    is treated in detail, describing the potential benefits of supporting interoperable
    interfaces in voting system components and a roadmap to their development. The
    gap analysis shows lack of support for data flows that involve ballot data, particularly
    ballot styles. These gaps preclude effective componentization of voting system
    devices such as ballot marking devices, election management systems and scanners.
    Identified solutions include standardization of ballot components, such as barcodes,
    and development of a ballot styles common data format.
