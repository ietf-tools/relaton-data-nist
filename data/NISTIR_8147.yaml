abstract:
- content: 'Upon the request of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a comprehensive
    literature review was conducted to gather and analyze existing research related
    to airborne emissions from non-smoldering cigarette butts. Based on the results
    from the literature review an experimental plan was developed to measure the airborne
    emissions from non-smoldering cigarette butts. The literature review found that:
    1) Non-smoldering cigarette butts can contain many of the same chemicals found
    in mainstream and sidestream smoke and they are a potential source of these chemicals
    in both indoor and outdoor environments; 2) A number of studies have investigated
    the chemicals found in cigarette butts and chemicals emitted from cigarette butts
    into water. However, there is very limited data on the emissions from cigarette
    butts into air; 3) The emission rates from cigarette butts into air may be minimal
    for some heavy chemicals (e.g., metals, tobacco-specific nitrosamines), but may
    be significant for more volatile chemicals (e.g., nicotine, pyridine, benzene);
    4) The airborne emissions of cigarette butts may be influenced by the cigarette
    brand, filter material, butt length, environmental temperature, air flow around
    the cigarette, number of puffs during smoking, degradation of the butt, and smoking
    method; 5) Much more data are needed on the airborne emission rates under different
    conditions. Based on the information from the literature review, the proposed
    research aims to fill the data gap by using a screening tool (e.g. headspace analysis)
    to examine the airborne emission from non-smoldering cigarette butts under various
    environmental conditions. Steps in the proposed investigation will include development
    of headspace analysis, selection of cigarette brand, determination of butt length,
    generation of cigarette butts, and determination of the target compounds.'
