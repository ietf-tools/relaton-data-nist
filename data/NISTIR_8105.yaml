abstract:
- content: In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum
    computers machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical
    problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale
    quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key
    cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality
    and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal
    of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to
    develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical
    computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.
    This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum
    cryptography, and outlines NIST s initial plan to move forward in this space.
    The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures
    and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.
