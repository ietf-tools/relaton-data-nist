abstract:
- content: 'Industrial control systems (ICS) are used in many industries to monitor
    and control physical processes. As ICS continue to adopt commercially available
    information technology (IT) to promote corporate business systems- connectivity
    and remote access capabilities, ICS become more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats.
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology''s (NIST''s) National Cybersecurity
    Center of Excellence (NCCoE), in conjunction with NIST''s Engineering Laboratory
    (EL), has demonstrated a set of behavioral anomaly detection capabilities to support
    cybersecurity in manufacturing organizations. These capabilities enable manufacturers
    to detect anomalous conditions in their operating environments to mitigate malware
    attacks and other threats to the integrity of critical operational data. NIST''s
    NCCoE and EL have mapped these demonstrated capabilities to the Cybersecurity
    Framework and have documented how this set of standards-based controls can support
    many of the security requirements of manufacturers. This report documents the
    use of behavioral anomaly detection (BAD) capabilities in two distinct but related
    demonstration environments: a robotics-based manufacturing system and a process
    control system that resembles what is being used by chemical manufacturing industries.'
