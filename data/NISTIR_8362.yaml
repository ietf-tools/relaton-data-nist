abstract:
- content: In the fall of 2019, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) funded threes studies to better understand equity and inclusivity. The
    present study represents phase three of a sequential, exploratory mixed methods
    study designed to provide an in- depth look at the population of NIST federal
    employees to identify factors, attitudes, and processes that might result in gender-
    specific barriers at NIST. From phase 1 and the phase 2 in-depth interview qualitative
    results an on-line survey was designed to quantify the differences, if any, in
    the ways in which men and women experience work at NIST. The target population
    was all NIST federal employees, approximately 3,300. The sample size was 1,350,
    approximately 30 % of the sampling frame. The survey consisted of six sections
    and was disseminated by email to the sampling frame. Participation was completely
    voluntary. The survey was open for three weeks. 1,529 employees responded to the
    survey for an overall response rate of 33.2 % and 1,108 completed the survey (resulting
    in an overall completion rate of 72.5 %). Survey participants demographics were
    representative of the overall distribution of staff across Directorates, Operating
    Units, age, years of service, career paths, pay bands, and educational levels.
    The chi-square test for independence was used to test for statistically significant
    differences between the NIST population and the survey respondents as a whole,
    as well as between men and women. Statistically significant differences (< 0.001)
    were found for men and women with respect to the organization's commitment to
    diversity and inclusivity (men are more positive than women) , on meritocracy
    (more women believe opportunities are based on who you know rather than most deserving
    employees) , and gendered experiences of being interrupted in meeting, questioning
    competence, and not receiving credit for ideas. More women believe they have to
    work harder, wait longer for promotion and opportunities for leadership. More
    women reported considering leaving NIST than their male counterparts. Both women
    and men agree they have equal opportunity to be hired, their need for work life
    balance is supported, that teamwork is valued, and NIST believes it is more objective
    than subjective and that projects are not more important than staff. Overall,
    the survey results align with the qualitative results and provide quantitative
    data on the differences in which men and women experience the culture, diversity
    and inclusivity of NIST.
