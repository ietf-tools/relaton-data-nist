abstract:
- content: 'The 2017 NIST/DHS/FDA Workshop: Standards for Pathogen Detection for Biosurveillance
    and Clinical Applications brought together subject matter experts from the clinical
    and biosurveillance communities to discuss standards to support the use of next
    generation sequencing for pathogen detection. The presentations, panel discussion,
    and break-out sessions focused on development and utilization of reference materials
    and standard operating procedures to assess measurement biases and overcome measurement
    and bioinformatic challenges and regulatory hurdles. This workshop was the third
    NIST-hosted workshop on sequencing for pathogen detection/identification since
    2014. Pathogen detection is relevant to a number of programmatic priorities within
    the NIST Material Measurement Laboratory including microbial metrology, precision
    medicine, biomanufacturing, biodefense/forensics, food safety, antibiotic resistance,
    and water quality. Thus, it is our intention at NIST to continue to host this
    workshop theme approximately every two years.'
