abstract:
- content: With the newly created Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN),
    the public safety community has a unique opportunity to review and improve communication
    technology for first responders, in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Understanding
    the problems and challenges currently experienced by first responders provides
    the basis for addressing and developing solutions to improve public safety communication.
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology Public Safety Communications
    Research (PSCR) usability team conducted in-depth interviews with approximately
    200 first responders representing 13 states in eight Federal Emergency Management
    Agency (FEMA) regions across the United States. From this larger dataset, this
    Volume 3 report focuses on the contexts and challenges specifically faced by rural
    first responders. This Volume utilizes 48 interviews with 63 rural first responders.
    A qualitative analysis of the transcribed interview data revealed unique issues
    posed by rural geography and topography; incident types specific to the rural
    environment; and resource challenges faced by rural first responder departments
    and agencies. Resource challenges include financial, personnel, and infrastructure.
    While there are many similarities between rural first responders and their urban
    and suburban counterparts, this Volume focuses on the unique nature of rural emergency
    response and its implications for technology needs and development. Understanding
    the specific challenges faced by first responders in rural communities can provide
    insight into the types of technology that might help them best respond to incidents
    effectively, efficiently, and safely.
