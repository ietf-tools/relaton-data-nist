abstract:
- content: Handbook 135 is a guide to understanding the life cycle cost (LCC) methodology
    and criteria established by the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) for the
    economic evaluation of high-performance facility projects, including energy efficiency,
    water conservation, and renewable energy projects in all federal facilities. It
    expands on the life cycle cost methods and criteria contained in the FEMP rules
    published in 10 CFR 436, Subpart A, which applies to all federal agencies. The
    purpose of this handbook is to facilitate the implementation of the FEMP rules
    by explaining the LCC method, defining the measures of economic performance used,
    describing the assumptions and procedures to follow in performing evaluations,
    giving examples, and noting NIST computer software available for computation and
    reporting purposes. An annual supplement to Handbook 135, Energy Price Indices
    and Discount Factors for LCC Analysis, NISTIR 85-3273, is also published by NIST
    to provide the current discount rate, discount factors, and energy escalation
    factors used for conducting an LCC analysis in accordance with the FEMP rules.
    This annual supplement is required when using Handbook 135 and is used in updating
    NIST LCC-related software. The 2020 edition of Handbook 135 superseded the 1995
    version and included extensive revisions and reorganization around the key steps
    in an LCC analysis. Although the underlying LCC methodology has not changed, the
    content of the handbook has been updated to include the most relevant information.
    Given the technological developments since its 1995 release, the manual worksheets
    previously provided for completing LCC analysis have been removed. The examples
    have been updated and expanded to provide explicit use cases for projects with
    a broader scope than energy efficiency and water conservation to include all considerations
    of high-performance facilities, including sustainability and resilience. Additionally,
    the handbook provides additional information resources (e.g., data sources, requirements,
    codes and standards, and guidance by project goal). This 2022 edition of Handbook
    135 supersedes the 2020 edition and includes minimal changes focused on addressing
    language in new executive orders and their implications on federal cost-effectiveness
    analysis. The handbook will be updated on an ad hoc basis dependent on future
    changes in federal statutes and regulations, agency goals and guidance, LCCA support
    resource development, and available funding.
