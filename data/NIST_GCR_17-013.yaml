abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is sponsoring
    the Community Resilience Assessment Methodology (CRAM) project. The CRAM project
    team is working in parallel with several other NIST initiatives, including: the
    Community Resilience Planning Guide for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems (https://www.nist.gov/el/resilience/community-resilience-
    planning-guides), the Center for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning (https://resilience.colostate.edu/),
    and the Community Resilience Panel for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems (https://www.crpanel.org/).
    The objective of the CRAM project is to develop a foundation for assessing resilience
    at the community scale. For the purposes of this project, community resilience
    is defined as the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and
    to withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions (PPD-21 2013), and a community
    is defined as a place designated by geographical boundaries that functions under
    the jurisdiction of a governance structure, such as a town, city, or county (NIST
    2015). This report continues the develop the concept of community dimensions and
    services and expands the concept to the dimensions of sustenance, housing and
    shelter, relationships, and education.'
