abstract:
- content: Risk management is an important topic in any domain. With the growing acceptance
    and adoption of Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI), both the academic and
    industrial communities are beginning to take a more serious look at the risks
    and rewards of using IAI. This paper summarizes insights generated at the 2021
    INFORMs panel addressing the risk-based evaluation of AI use from both a performance
    and business impacts perspective. The summarized insights are gathered and presented
    in a logical fashion to highlight identified gaps and barriers in the evaluation
    and adoption of IAI technologies. Additional context and suggestions regarding
    paths forward are provided by the authors.
