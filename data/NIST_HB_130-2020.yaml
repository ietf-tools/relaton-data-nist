abstract:
- content: This handbook compiles the latest Uniform Laws and Regulations and related
    interpretations and guidelines adopted by the National Conference on Weights and
    Measures, Inc. (NCWM). At the 1983 Annual Meeting, the NCWM voted to change the
    title of Handbook 130 and the title of the Laws and Regulations compiled in this
    handbook. The former title of the handbook was 'Model State Laws and Regulations.'
    'Model State' was to be changed to 'Uniform' in the title to reflect that these
    Laws and Regulations are (a) intended to be standards rather than just guidelines,
    and (b) intended for adoption by political subdivisions other than states when
    deemed appropriate. This edition includes amendments approved at the 104th NCWM
    Annual Meetings in 2019. The NCWM recommends adoption and promulgation by weights
    and measures jurisdictions of these Uniform Laws and Regulations as updated in
    this handbook. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the
    statutory responsibility to promote 'cooperate with the states in securing uniformity
    in weights and measures laws and methods of inspection.'' In partial fulfillment
    of this responsibility, the Institute is pleased to publish these recommendations
    of the NCWM. This handbook promotes the primary use of the International System
    of Units (SI) by citing SI units before U.S. customary units where both units
    appear together, and by placing separate sections containing requirements for
    SI units before corresponding sections containing requirements for customary units.
    In some cases, however, trade practice is currently restricted to the use of customary
    units; therefore, some requirements in this handbook will continue to specify
    only customary units until the NCWM achieves a broad consensus on the permitted
    metric units.
