abstract:
- content: This document provides an IEC 61850 profile for a Distributed Energy Resource
    supporting IEEE 1547 and the grid support functions therein. The profile utilizes
    the IEC 61850 data object model and maps the requirements of IEEE 1547 to the
    data object model for the integration of DERs in the electric power system. By
    establishing a required subset of data objects and data attributes from the IEC
    61850 model, the profile reduces model complexity and aims to improve the interoperability,
    and the engineering, testing and maintenance of IEC 61850 based protection, automation
    and control systems. A description of how the profile maps the IEEE 1547 requirements
    to the required IEC 61850 data objects is provided and use case examples are given.
