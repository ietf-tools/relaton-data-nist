abstract:
- content: Timely patching is critical to maintain the operational availability, confidentiality,
    and integrity of IT systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application
    software patched is the most common mistake made by information technology (IT)
    professionals. To help address this growing problem, this special publication
    recommends methods to help organizations have an explicit and documented patching
    and vulnerability policy and a systematic, accountable, and documented process
    for handling patches. This document also covers areas such as prioritizing patches,
    obtaining patches, testing patches, and applying patches.
