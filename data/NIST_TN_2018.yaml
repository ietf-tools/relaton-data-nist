abstract:
- content: This paper is a summary of our current recommendations for iris camera
    selection. NIST is developing these recommendations in collaboration with the
    FBI, other US Government entities with interests in the use of iris recognition
    technology, and the larger iris recognition community. It is intended to give
    brief, practical guidance to persons planning to purchase iris recognition cameras,
    particularly for use in law enforcement activities. It is also intended as a basis
    for an ongoing discussion on camera selection that began at the Iris Expert Group
    meeting in June 2018. The primary focus of these recommendations is compliance
    with standards and processes that enable interchange of data between government
    entities, as permitted by regulation and policy, and that enable cost effective
    improvements as technology advances.
