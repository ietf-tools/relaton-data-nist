abstract:
- content: This Federal Information Processing Standard (140-2) specifies the security
    requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module, providing four
    increasing, qualitative levels intended to cover a wide range of potential applications
    and environments. The areas covered, related to the secure design and implementation
    of a cryptographic module, include specification; ports and interfaces; roles,
    services, and authentication; finite state model; physical security; operational
    environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design assurance; and mitigation of other
    attacks. [Supersedes FIPS 140-1 (January 11, 1994)]
