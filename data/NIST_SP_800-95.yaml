abstract:
- content: The advance of Web services technologies promises to have far-reaching
    effects on the Internet and enterprise networks. Web services based on the eXtensible
    Markup Language (XML), SOAP, and related open standards, and deployed in Service
    Oriented Architectures (SOA) allow data and applications to interact without human
    intervention through dynamic and ad hoc connections. The security challenges presented
    by the Web services approach are formidable and unavoidable. Many of the features
    that make Web services attractive, including greater accessibility of data, dynamic
    application-to-application connections, and relative autonomy are at odds with
    traditional security models and controls. Ensuring the security of Web services
    involves augmenting traditional security mechanisms with security frameworks based
    on use of authentication, authorization, confidentiality, and integrity mechanisms.
    This document describes how to implement those security mechanisms in Web services.
    It also discusses how to make Web services and portal applications robust against
    the attacks to which they are subject.
