abstract:
- content: The report includes proceedings of a workshop sponsored jointly by NIST
    and the Schools of Technology and Science, Norfolk State University, Norfolk,
    Virginia, and held in Gaithersburg, Maryland, November 13-15, 1990. The workshop
    theme was strengthening materials education. Material in the publication can serve
    as a valuable guide to faculty who are interested in useful experiments for their
    students. There was a blend of experiments on new materials and traditional materials.
    Uses of computers in MS&E, experuimental design and an approach to A ystematic
    materials are among the topics presented.
