abstract:
- content: 'The nonparametric two-sample bootstrap is employed to estimate uncertainties
    of statistics of interest in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
    on large datasets with/without data dependency due to multiple use of the same
    subjects in many disciplines, based on our studies of bootstrap variability. On
    the other hand, it would seem that the analytical method might be used for the
    same purpose. However, comparing these two methods, the differences are noteworthy.
    (1) The bootstrap method takes account of how genuine scores and impostor scores
    are distributed, which is associated with how the matching system works; but the
    analytical method does not. (2) If datasets involve data dependency, the bootstrap
    method can take it into account; but the analytical method cannot. (3) The covariance
    term that occurred in the speaker recognition evaluations while estimating the
    standard error of the measure can be taken into account intrinsically by the bootstrap
    method; but it is very hard to estimate analytically. (4) The analytical method
    generally underestimates the uncertainties of statistics of interest; but the
    bootstrap method estimates them more conservatively. To demonstrate these observations,
    the data used in this article were generated from a variety of sources: speaker
    recognition evaluations, biometrics evaluations, simulated data with normal distributions,
    and simulated data with nonparametric distributions.'
