abstract:
- content: The construction sector is increasingly focused on improving energy and
    material efficiency to reduce its environmental impact. One promising approach
    gaining traction is the shift from a traditional linear economic model (extract,
    make, use, discard) to a circular model. In a circular economy (CE), materials
    are designed to have lower environmental impacts and are retained in the economy
    for as long as possible, thereby reducing resource depletion, environmental impact,
    and waste generation, while creating new business opportunities and jobs. Concrete,
    a widely used construction material, is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions
    due to cement production. Efforts are underway to transition the cement and concrete
    industries to a CE. Strategies include infrastructure design to optimize concrete
    use and enable repair and reuse, as well as advanced material design such as the
    use of alternative cementitious materials, improved energy efficiency in production,
    and carbon capture from production and sequestration in concrete. However, challenges
    hinder the transition to a CE, including the industry's established technologies
    and supply chains, the need for demonstrated reliability of new materials, and
    lack of a trained workforce capable of designing and constructing with lowcarbon
    materials. To overcome these challenges requires a collaborative, systems-level
    approach, with clear goals, harmonized metrics, robust assessment tools, standards
    development, workforce training, and coordinated regulatory efforts. The U.S.
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) can support the transition
    to a CE by advancing measurement science, developing data resources and modeling
    tools, participating in standards development, and convening necessary stakeholders
    to facilitate collaborative engagement.
