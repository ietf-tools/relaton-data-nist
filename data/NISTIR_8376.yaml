abstract:
- content: In the fall of 2019, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) funded three studies to better understand equity and inclusivity. This
    report is a comprehensive integration and summary of the sequential, exploratory
    mixed methods study designed to provide an in-depth look at the population of
    NIST federal employees to identify factors, attitudes, and processes that might
    result in gender-specific barriers for women at NIST. This final report integrates
    the findings from the three phases providing a holistic view by focusing on the
    themes that emerged from the qualitative in-depth interviews and examining the
    extent to which and in which ways the quantitative survey and human resources
    data confirm or challenge the qualitative results. An overwhelming theme and feeling
    of frustration became evident during the examination of the data from the holistic
    perspective. NIST staff expressed frustration and exhaustion with the focus on
    women and not other groups, with the entire subject matter of diversity and inclusivity,
    with the slow pace of change, and some with reverse discrimination. Overall, the
    three phases align and provide a consistent view on the differences in how women
    and men experience NIST, the culture, diversity and inclusivity.
