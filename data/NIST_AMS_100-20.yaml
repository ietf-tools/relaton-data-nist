abstract:
- content: This annual report characterizes US innovation and industrial competitiveness
    in manufacturing. It includes tracking domestic manufacturing activity and its
    domestic supply chain in order to develop a quantitative depiction of US manufacturing
    in the context of the domestic economy and global industry. This depiction provides
    change agents, such as public entities and trade groups that invest in advancing
    the current state of manufacturing, insight into the current state and recent
    trends in US manufacturing. The report further identifies areas of manufacturing
    that can have large impacts on costs.
