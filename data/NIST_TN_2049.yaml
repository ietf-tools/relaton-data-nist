abstract:
- content: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is focused on addressing
    the hazard of acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning of consumers from portable
    generators that can result in death or serious and/or lasting adverse health effects
    in exposed individuals. Under an interagency agreement with CPSC (CPSC-I-17-0023),
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a series of
    tests to characterize the indoor CO concentrations and the associated calculated
    carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) profiles on simulated occupants resulting from portable
    generators operating in or near a test house. The tests are intended to provide
    information to enable CPSC staff to make comparisons of residential CO exposures
    reflecting operation of current designs of portable engine-driven electric generators,
    inside or near homes or in attached garages, versus operation of portable generators
    equipped with a CO safety shutoff device. This report presents measured CO data
    and calculated COHb levels based on that CO data from tests conducted with five
    different generators under various operational and environmental conditions. Those
    data were then used to evaluate how well the indoor air quality model CONTAM can
    predict CO levels in the garage and the house in support of a planned study that
    CPSC staff will use to evaluate the impact of CO mitigation requirements in two
    recently-published voluntary standards
