abstract:
- content: Data exchange transactions for the engineering, procurement, and operation
    of process equipment depend heavily on product data sheets. Product data sheets
    are traditional paper forms that serve as the main method of communicating detailed
    equipment specifications. There are many standards for the layout and use of product
    data sheets, but there are still problems with the data exchanges that use them.
    First, most transactions are still done with the exchange of document images,
    e.g., scanned product data sheets, which have to be interpreted by humans and
    transcribed for use in a software tool. Second, the commonly used machine-interpretable
    forms of product data sheets are created using spreadsheet tools, but there is
    often disagreement on terminology and on the intended meaning of certain fields.
    This publication introduces the concept of a Product Data Sheet Ontology covering
    the types of information included on product data sheets. The ontology is a formal
    machine-readable terminology that is based on industry standard glossaries of
    terms and definitions. The paper specifically includes the concepts used in Centrifugal
    Pump, Pressure Transmitter, and Valve data sheets. The paper depicts the product
    data sheet concepts and their relationships in UML diagrams and describes them
    in detail in text. The UML models are used to generate computer-interpretable
    OWL ontologies. The text includes the relationships of the ontology elements to
    industry standards for product data sheet information.
