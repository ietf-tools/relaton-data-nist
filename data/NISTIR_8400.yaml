abstract:
- content: 'The Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) is being developed
    to provide a dedicated network for first responders use during incident response.
    A wave of new communication technologies compatible with the NPSBN is on the horizon,
    as major research and development efforts for these technologies are ongoing.
    The aim of the NIST PSCR Usability Team is to gain a better understanding of the
    usability of communication technology for first responders, by investigating the
    contexts in which they work, their experiences with incident response, and their
    problems with and needs for communication technology. To this end, NIST s PSCR
    Usability Team conducted an exploratory, sequential, mixed-methods study to gather
    insights into the experiences and needs of first responders. The multi-phase study
    included in-depth interviews with 193 first responders, followed by a nationwide
    survey of 7 182 first responders. This report is the third of the series of volumes
    on Phase 2, presenting survey results related to first responder experiences with
    their day-to-day devices: frequency of use of these devices, useful rankings of
    the devices, and problems experienced with them. Four overarching themes that
    have implications for R&D of first responder communication technology are presented
    in this report, reinforcing the six user-centered design guidelines identified
    in the Phase 1, Volume 1 report. These themes and guidelines can aid researchers,
    designers, and developers in the public safety domain in attending to those issues
    that are most important to first responders.'
