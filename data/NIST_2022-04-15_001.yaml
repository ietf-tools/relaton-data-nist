abstract:
- content: 'The purpose of the Historic Structure Report is to examine the architectural
    history of these significant federal buildings, inventory character defining features,
    and establish Preservation Zones to inform future maintenance and renovations.
    This report incorporates the information and research specific to the architecture
    of General Purpose Laboratories on the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This report addresses all exterior and
    interior spaces and features (excluding structural, mechanical, electrical, and
    plumbing building systems) of the following General Purpose Laboratories: Buildings
    220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, and 226. The Historic Structure Report is intended
    to be used as a reference document for the NIST, the Office of Facilities and
    Property Management (OFPM) and its staff as well as for outside contractors of
    the existing conditions and their relative significance for consideration when
    planning, designing and completing work on General Purpose Laboratories. While
    every effort has been made to document and evaluate significant architectural
    and construction features, it is not intended to limit future changes required
    by ever-evolving mission of scientific research that defines the agency.'
