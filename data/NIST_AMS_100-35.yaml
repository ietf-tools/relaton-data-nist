- content: Co-axial melt pool monitoring in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive
    manufacturing (AM) often utilizes various photodetectors to acquire signals relatable
    to the dynamic thermal melt pool phenomena. In turn, it is expected that these
    thermal signatures are relatable to the quality of the fabrication and can therefore
    the final AM part. To relate these signal values to real, physical temperatures,
    a thermal calibration must be done. However, the relatively high temperatures
    and small size of typical LPBF melt pools cannot be easily replicated by most
    thermal calibration sources. This paper describes a potential method for thermal
    calibration, which uses a lower temperature, commercial off-the-shelf calibration
    blackbody. The method calculates an ⁰́₈effective⁰́₉ temperature for a hypothetical
    small source of any diameter, which would have the same radiance temperature of
    the larger, lower temperature blackbody. The paper details the theoretical rationale,
    provides a proof-of-concept calculation, then demonstrates the procedures conducted
    on a commercial LPBF melt pool monitoring system. Finally, while this method itself
    does not provide an absolute calibration nor ability to ascribe real melt pool
    temperatures to the melt pool monitoring sensor signals, discussion is provided
    that details the practical utility, details why the measured calibration values
    are realistic, and describes future improvements to the methodology.
