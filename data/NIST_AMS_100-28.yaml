abstract:
- content: 'This report provides an overview of the US manufacturing industry. There
    are three aspects of US manufacturing that are considered: (1) how the US industry
    compares to other countries, (2) the trends in the domestic industry, and (3)
    the industry trends compared to those in other countries. The US remains a major
    manufacturing nation; however, other countries are rising rapidly. US manufacturing
    was significantly impacted by the previous recession and has only recently returned
    to pre-recession levels of production and still remains below pre-recession employment
    levels. Although US manufacturing performs well in many respects, there are opportunities
    for advancing competitiveness. This will require strategic placement of resources
    to ensure that US investments have the highest return possible.'
