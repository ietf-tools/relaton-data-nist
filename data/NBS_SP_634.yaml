abstract:
- content: In the past, for the most part, precision electromagnetic measurements
    were concerned with the measurement of parameters for sinusoidal (or steady state)
    excitation and response, e.g., magnitude, phase, and power. One reason for the
    popularity of frequency domain measurement was that in this domain only one complete
    data point need be recorded to constitute a useful measurement. Recording a thousand
    data points as required for precision time domain waveform measurements simply
    was not feasible. Today such frequency domain measurements are still important
    but now share their importance with transient pulse time domain measurements.
    With the emergence of integrated circuit components for (1) sampling or analog
    to digital conversion, (2) storage, and (3) control, real time digital waveform
    recording is now practical and widespread in usage. Furthermore, by coupling waveform
    recording components to minicomputers and microprocessors integrated circuitry
    it is now possible to record single events using compact systems (instruments)
    which acquire, record, process, and analyze transient signals. In fact, the incorporation
    of digital computation integrated circuitry appears to be a major driving force
    in expanding the role of waveform measurements in the academic, industrial and
    scientific communities.
