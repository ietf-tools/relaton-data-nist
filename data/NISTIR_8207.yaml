abstract:
- content: 'Iris Exchange (IREX) IX is an evaluation of automated iris recognition
    algorithms. The first part of the evaluation is a performance test of both verification
    (one-to-one) and identification (one-to-many) recognition algorithms over operational
    test data. The results are summarized in this report. Thirteen developers submitted
    recognition algorithms for testing, more than any previous IREX evaluation. Performance
    was measured for 46 matching algorithms over a set of approximately 700K field-collected
    iris images. This report is very similar to IREX IV: Part 1, Evaluation of Iris
    Identification Algorithms in both format and scope.'
