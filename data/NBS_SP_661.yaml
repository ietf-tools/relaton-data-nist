abstract:
- content: 'ASTM and NBS co-sponsored a Basestock Consistency Study (BCS) to assess
    the quality consistency of lubricating base oils. This study, which is the first
    of its kind, will impact on developing basestock characterization methodology
    and on efficient utilization of energy resources as well as their conservation
    through recycling. The purpose of this publication is to present the ASTM/NBS
    BCS data for data analysis. Monthly production samples from six re-refiners and
    four refiners were analyzed by 14 laboratories for a 13 month period. The results
    of over 55 tests are divided according to six major categories: rheology, physical
    properties, chemical properties, hydrocarbon type analysis, general performance
    tests, and oxidation and wear bench tests. The data are presented in tabular and
    grphical form, which is quite amenable to further data analysis.'
