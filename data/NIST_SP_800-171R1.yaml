abstract:
- content: The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in
    nonfederal systems and organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies
    and can directly impact the ability of the federal government to successfully
    conduct its assigned missions and business operations. This publication provides
    federal agencies with a set of recommended security requirements for protecting
    the confidentiality of CUI when such information is resident in nonfederal systems
    and organizations; when the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining
    information on behalf of a federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf
    of an agency; and where there are no specific safeguarding requirements for protecting
    the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or government-wide
    policy for the CUI category or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry. The security
    requirements apply to all components of nonfederal systems and organizations that
    process, store, or transmit CUI, or that provide security protection for such
    components. The requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual
    vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and nonfederal
    organizations.
