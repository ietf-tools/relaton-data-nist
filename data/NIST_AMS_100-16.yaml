abstract:
- content: Additive manufacturing (AM) is a revolutionary manufacturing technique,
    which is expected to reshape the future manufacturing industries. While various
    materials are used in AM, metal AM is expected to provide a high impact to the
    industries by producing high-strength structural components. Defects occurring
    in AM, however, prevent the technique from a wide spread adoption to the mainstream
    industry. This paper provides a review of commonly-occurring defects in metal
    AM-produced components. It describes various types and causes of defects, provides
    implications on the needs of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to inspect
    such defects.
