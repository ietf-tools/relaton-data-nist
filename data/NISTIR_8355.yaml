abstract:
- content: This publication from NICE describes Competency Areas as included in the
    Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework), NIST Special Publication
    800-181, Revision 1. The NICE Framework is a fundamental reference for describing
    and sharing information about cybersecurity work. At its core are Task, Knowledge,
    and Skill (TKS) statements that provide a foundation for learners, including students,
    job seekers, and employees. These statements are then used to define Competency
    Areas—clusters of related Knowledge and Skill statements that correlates with
    one’s capability to perform Tasks in a particular domain—and Work Roles, which
    are composed of Task statements that constitute work for which someone is responsible
    or accountable. This document shares more detail about what NICE Framework Competency
    Areas are, including their evolution and development, clarifies the differences
    between Competency Areas and Work Roles, and provides example uses for Competency
    Areas from various stakeholder perspectives, and. Finally, the publication identifies
    where the NICE Framework list of Competency Areas is separately published and
    maintained distinct from this publication so it can be updated more frequently
    as a flexible and contemporary reference resource.
