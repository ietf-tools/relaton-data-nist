abstract:
- content: Wireless communication is becoming crucial to advanced manufacturing. Industry
    4.0 and SmartManufacturing depend on networked industrial automation systems.
    The term Industrial Internet ofThings (IIoT) has been used to describe the deployment
    of interconnected machines, sensors, andactuators within modernized factories.
    The adoption of wireless systems is essential to these IIoTdeployments. Wireless
    automation significantly reduces capital investment costs including conduit,cables,
    networking equipment, and labor of installation. To enable the adoption of wireless
    systems atthe factory-floor level, wireless requirements must be established to
    realize the benefits of wirelesscommunication systems within those factories.
    One challenge is that existing wireless standards lacktechnical specifications
    that support low-latency and high-reliability communication for factoryapplications.
    Additionally, requirements for such capabilities are published or advertised withoutvalidation
    of said requirements. Often, requirements published by standards developmentorganizations
    appear excessively strict and unvalidated by empirical study. Moreover, thoserequirements
    ignore the capabilities of the applications to use their own intelligence to compensatefor
    lost reliability in the network. This report analyzes existing wireless user requirements
    stated byindustry organizations and it produces a combined perspective on wireless
    user requirements for thefactory workcell with supporting rationale.
