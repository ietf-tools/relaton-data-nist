abstract:
- content: As awareness of cybersecurity supply chain risks grows among federal agencies,
    there is a greater need for tools that evaluate the impacts of a supply chain-related
    cyber event. This can be a difficult activity, especially for those organizations
    with complex operational environments and supply chains. A publicly available
    tool to support supply chain risk analysis that specifically takes into account
    the potential impact of an event does not currently exist. This publication describes
    how to use the Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Interdependency Tool
    that has been developed to help federal agencies identify and assess the potential
    impact of cybersecurity events in their interconnected supply chains.
