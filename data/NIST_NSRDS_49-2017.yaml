abstract:
- content: The CYCLE_D package simulates vapor compression refrigeration cycles that
    use pure refrigerants or blends of refrigerants. The model can simulate a basic
    subcritical or transcritical refrigeration cycle, both with or without a liquid-line/suction-line
    heat exchanger. In addition, the model can simulate a subcritical two-stage economizer
    cycle, a subcritical three- stage economizer cycle, and a subcritical two-stage
    compression cycle with intercooling. CYCLE_D operates in a Microsoft Windows environment
    that facilitates evaluating the performance of selected working fluids at different
    operating conditions. Calculations are based on refrigerant properties as represented
    in the NIST Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties Program REFPROP,
    Version 9.1 [1].
