abstract:
- content: 'This report summarizes the results from the 2018 NIST/OAGi Workshop: Enabling
    Composable ServiceOriented Manufacturing Systems, which was held at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology campus in Gaithersburg, MD, on April 23-24,
    2018. This was the fourth in this series of workshops begun in 2015 to foster
    a shared vision of a new Smart Manufacturing (SM) platform to support Composable
    Service-Oriented Manufacturing (SOM) systems. The purpose of the workshop series
    is to identify and discuss challenges in advancing the vision within the context
    of open cloud service platforms for Smart Manufacturing systems. Like the previous
    workshop reports, the document gives (1) summaries of presentations on Smart Manufacturing
    and the theme of Composable Service-Oriented Manufacturing systems, (2) summaries
    of the six breakout sessions, each providing a unique perspective on the theme,
    and (3) the key findings from the workshop.'
