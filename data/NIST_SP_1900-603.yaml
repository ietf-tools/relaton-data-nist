abstract:
- content: The NIST Transactive Energy (TE) Modeling and Simulation Challenge for
    the Smart Grid (Challenge) spanned from 2015 to 2018. The TE Challenge was initiated
    to identify simulation tools and expertise that might be developed or combined
    in co-simulation platforms to enable the evaluation of transactive energy approaches.
    Phase I of the Challenge spanned 2015 to 2016, with team efforts that improved
    understanding of TE concepts, identified relevant simulation tools and co-simulation
    platforms, and inspired the development of a TE co-simulation abstract component
    model that paved the way for Phase II. The Phase II effort spanned Spring 2017
    through Spring 2018, where the teams collaboratively developed a specific TE problem
    scenario, a common grid topology, and common reporting metrics to enable direct
    comparison of results from simulation of each team's TE approach for the defined
    scenario. This report presents an overview of the TE Challenge, the TE abstract
    component model, and the common scenario. It also compiles the individual Challenge
    participants' research reports from Phase II. The common scenario involves a weather
    event impacting a distribution grid with very high penetration of photovoltaics,
    leading to voltage regulation challenges that are to be mitigated by TE methods.
    Four teams worked with this common scenario and different TE models to incentivize
    distributed resource response to voltage deviations, performing these simulations
    on different simulation platforms. A fifth team focused on a co-simulation platform
    that can be used for online TE simulations with existing co-simulation components.
    The TE Challenge Phase II has advanced co-simulation modeling tools and platforms
    for TE system performance analysis, developed a referenceable TE scenario that
    can support ongoing comparative simulations, and demonstrated various TE approaches
    for managing voltage on a distribution grid with high penetration of photovoltaics.
