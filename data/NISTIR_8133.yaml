abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established
    a Vitamin D Metabolites Quality Assurance Program (VitDQAP) in collaboration with
    the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements. Participants
    in the eighth exercise of this program, the Winter 2014 Comparability Study, were
    asked to use the methodology of their choice to measure concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin
    D in pooled human serum control and study materials distributed by NIST. The study
    materials consisted of Standard Reference Material (SRM) 909c Human Serum and
    VitDQAP-III (a material designed for the VitDQAP). SRM 968d Fat-Soluble Vitamins,
    Carotenoids, and Cholesterol in Human Serum Level 1 was provided as a control
    material. Participants provided their data to NIST, where it was compiled and
    evaluated for trueness relative to the NIST value and concordance within the participant
    community. A report of results was provided to all participants of the study,
    and laboratories were identified by code numbers known only to them. The results
    from this eighth study are reported along with a summary of the analytical methods
    used.
