abstract:
- content: The 2017 edition of NIST Handbook 150-22 incorporates changes resulting
    from revisions to the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) Version 1.1, the
    Election Assistance Commission's (EAC) Testing and Certification Program Manual
    Version 2.0, and the EAC Voting System Test Laboratory Program Manual Version
    2.0., as well as editorial improvements. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150
    and the specific requirements and interpretations in NIST Handbook 150-22 must
    be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP Voting System
    Testing program. For more information, visit the NVLAP website.
