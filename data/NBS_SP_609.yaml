abstract:
- content: These proceedings are the compilation of 21 papers presented at a seminar
    on Traceability for Ionizing Radiation Measurements held at the National Bureau
    of Standards, Gaithersburg, MD, on May 8-9, 1980. General concepts for traceability
    were presented from several perspectives. The national standards for radiation
    dosimetry, radioactivity measurements, and neutron measurements were described.
    Specific programs for achieving traceability to the national standards for radiation
    measurements in medical, occupational, and environmental applications were summarized.
