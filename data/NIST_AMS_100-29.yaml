abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the eleventh
    installment of the Model-Based Enterprise Summit (MBE 2020) on March 31 through
    April 2, 2020 in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The MBE 2020 witnessed another year-over-year
    registration and attendance growth. The MBE Summit saw hundreds of attendees gather
    over three days to share their experiences with Model-Based Enterprise (MBE).
    This speaks to the continued growing interest of MBE within the community and
    the importance of the Summit output. The goal of the MBE Summit is to identify
    challenges, research, implementation issues, and lessons learned in design, manufacturing,
    quality assurance, and sustainment of products and processes where a digital three-dimensional
    (3D) model of the product serves as the authoritative information source for all
    activities in a product''s lifecycle. The theme of MBE 2020 was Increasing MBE
    Adoption and Implementation. There is no doubt that MBE requires a complex organizational
    work design that recognizes the interaction between people, skills, and technology
    in workplaces. The 11th MBE Summit is focused on highlighting the organizational
    culture surrounding MBE, needs of people operating in MBE, and real-world implementations
    of MBE in practice. Authors from academia, government, and industry submitted
    papers on topics related to this year''s theme using the following tracks: 1)
    Business Processes; 2) Organization Culture; 3) Technology; and 4) Workforce Skills.
    This volume contains the papers presented at MBE 2020. The MBE 2020 program included
    four invited talks, five tutorials, five panels, and 25 papers. In addition, the
    MBE 2020 program included a vendor-demonstration track where solution providers
    and vendors demonstrated MBE offerings.'
