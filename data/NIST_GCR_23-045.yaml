abstract:
- content: In September 2022, the Structural Engineering Institute of the American
    Society of Engineers commenced a project under National Institute of Standards
    and Technology Contract No.1333ND22PNB730391 to develop workshops on Advancement
    in Computational Wind Engineering and Advancement in Performance-Based Wind Design.
    This report documents the results of the workshop on Advancement in Performance-Based
    Wind Design. The workshop and subsequent roadmap for the standardization and application
    of performance-based wind design is to be developed by wind engineering practitioners
    and researchers for buildings.
