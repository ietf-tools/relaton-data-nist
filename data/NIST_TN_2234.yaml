abstract:
- content: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus
    (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. As noted by ASHRAE and the Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), engineering and other controls should be
    part of a broader, layered risk reduction strategy that includes hand washing,
    surface cleaning, social distancing, and reduced occupant density (ASHRAE 2020;
    CDC 2021). To date, many recommendations for operating buildings during and re-opening
    them post-pandemic have been based upon limited or no data. Much of the public
    discussion of re-opening buildings has focused on commercial and institutional
    buildings in the U.S., but there are almost 20 times more residences in the U.S.
    than there are commercial buildings. Major questions exist regarding the development
    of recommendations targeting residences, in part because dwellings can be a major
    source of virus transmission. To help more people leverage ventilation and filtration
    in their homes effectively, the authors used the Fate and Transport of Indoor
    Microbial Particles (FaTIMA) tool to evaluate the effects of ventilation and filtration
    strategies on particle exposure in homes of various sizes, with different ventilation
    systems, and with a contagious visitor in the home for various durations. After
    comparing particle exposure in a set of base cases for all home sizes and ventilation
    systems, a 297 CADR portable air cleaner was most effective for reducing particle
    exposure compared to the other mitigation measures simulated (average 45 % reduction
    in exposure).
