abstract:
- content: For homes to become active participants in a smart grid, intelligent control
    algorithms are needed to facilitate autonomous interactions that take homeowner
    preferences into consideration. Many control algorithms for demand response have
    been proposed in the literature. Comparing the performance of these algorithms
    has been difficult because each algorithm makes different assumptions or considers
    different scenarios, i.e., peak load reduction or minimizing cost in response
    to the variable price of electricity. This work proposes a flexible assessment
    framework using the Analytical Hierarchy Process to compare and rank residential
    energy management control algorithms. The framework is a hybrid mechanism that
    derives a ranking from a combination of subjective user input representing preferences,
    and object data from the algorithm performance related to energy consumption,
    cost and comfort. The Analytical Hierarchy Process results in a single overall
    score used to rank the alternatives. The approach is illustrated by applying the
    assessment process to six residential energy management control algorithms.
