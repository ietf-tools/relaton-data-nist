abstract:
- content: 'CONTAM is a multizone indoor air quality and ventilation analysis program
    developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Dols and
    Polidoro 2015). CONTAM generates a wide range of different simulation outputs
    in the form of binary and text-based files. CONTAM provides the ability to view
    a limited set of these results via the CONTAM graphical user interface, but many
    users require access to a much broader range of results. The CONTAM Results Export
    Tool (subsequently referred to as Export Tool ) was created to provide access
    to all of the results that can be generated by a CONTAM simulation. It does so
    by reading the binary result files and converting them to tab-delimited text files
    that can be read using a spreadsheet program. The results that can be exported
    include contaminant concentrations; zone temperatures; weather conditions; airflows
    through individual paths, ducts and duct leakages; temporal and spatial averages
    of zone concentrations; and exposure results. The Export Tool also includes the
    ability to export infiltration rates for use in simulations performed with the
    EnergyPlus whole-building energy simulation program. This document describes five
    features of the Export Tool: (1) general conversion of binary results to text,
    (2) computing temporal and spatial averages of zone contaminant concentrations,
    (3) exporting occupant exposure results, (4) exporting whole-building air change
    rates from a CONTAM simulation for use in EnergyPlus, and (5) exporting zone-specific
    air change rates from a CONTAM simulation for use in EnergyPlus. The Export Tool
    is available, along with CONTAM and other NISTdeveloped software, on the NIST
    Multizone Modeling Website http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/IAQanalysis.'
