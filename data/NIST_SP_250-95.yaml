abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides calibration
    services for submitted artifacts for luminous intensity, illuminance, color temperature,
    total luminous flux, luminous exposure and luminance. Additionally, the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology issues calibrated standards of luminous
    intensity, luminance, and color temperature. The procedures, equipment, and techniques
    used to perform these calibrations are described. Detailed estimates and procedures
    for determining uncertainties of the reported values are also presented along
    with the internal quality control procedures.
