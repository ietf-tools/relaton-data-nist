abstract:
- content: In September 2016, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education,
    led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. Department
    of Commerce, awarded funding for five pilot programs for Regional Alliances and
    Multistakeholder Partnerships to Stimulate (RAMPS) Cybersecurity Education and
    Workforce Development. The document that follows provides a summary of the five
    pilot programs and outlines a roadmap for building similar programs based on the
    best practices found and lessons learned.
