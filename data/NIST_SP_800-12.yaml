abstract:
- content: This handbook provides assistance in securing computer-based resources
    (including hardware, software, and information) by explaining important concepts,
    cost considerations, and interrelationships of security controls. It illustrates
    the benefits of security controls, the major techniques or approaches for each
    control, and important related considerations. The handbook provides a broad overview
    of computer security to help readers understand their computer security needs
    and develop a sound approach to the selection of appropriate security controls.
    It does not describe detailed steps necessary to implement a computer security
    program, provide detailed implementation procedures for security controls, or
    give guidance for auditing the security of specific systems.
