abstract:
- content: In September 2013, an area of the Rocky Mountains region referred to as
    the Colorado Front Range experienced unprecedented rainfall that resulted in multiple
    days of flooding. This flooding caused significant damage to homes, commercial
    structures, roads, bridges, infrastructure systems, and parks and open space across
    the region, including Boulder County⁰₉s communities and mountain towns. Flooding,
    particularly flash flooding, is a primary hazard of concern in the region. The
    City of Boulder and Boulder County have implemented programs and preparedness
    measures to mitigate the risk, respond to, and recover from floods. Boulder County
    communities have been investing for decades to improve infrastructure systems,
    avoid development in hazard-prone areas, and implement financial and administrative
    programs to mitigate potential flooding damage. Government officials who had gained
    experience during the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Wildfire were also responsible for
    ensuring that their communities had the resources and support necessary to rebuild
    and restore community services after the 2013 flood. In the years since the 2013
    flood, communities have rebuilt and recovered with an emphasis on reducing future
    vulnerability. The collective experiences of those who helped prepare for and
    recover from the Boulder County flood are documented in this series of case studies
    of community resilience planning. The IDA Science and Technology Policy Institute,
    with support from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Community
    Resilience Group, conducted case studies of Boulder County community resilience
    planning before, during, and after the 2013 flood. Three case studies focus on
    unincorporated Boulder County, the City of Boulder, and the towns of Lyons and
    Jamestown. A primary focus of the research was to document the recovery efforts
    within each case study; the programs, policies, or broader efforts employed by
    each community to design and construct resilient infrastructure; and the efforts
    to ensure community services (e.g., housing and public health) were provided throughout
    the multi-year recovery process. Research is based on publicly available literature,
    including reports published by Boulder County governments, and discussions with
    Boulder County community officials in 2015 and 2016.
