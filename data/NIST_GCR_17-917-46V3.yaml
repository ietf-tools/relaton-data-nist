abstract:
- content: 'In September 2014, the Applied Technology Council (ATC) commenced a task
    order project under National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Contract
    SB1341-13-CQ-0009 to develop guidance for nonlinear dynamic analysis (ATC-114
    Project). The need for such guidance is identified as high-priority research and
    development topic (Proposed Research Initiative 6) in NIST GCR 14-917-27 report,
    Nonlinear Analysis Research and Development Program for Performance-Based Seismic
    Engineering (NIST, 2013), which outlines a research and development program for
    addressing the gap between state-of-the-art academic research and state-of-practice
    engineering applications for nonlinear structural analysis, analytical structural
    modeling, and computer simulation in support of performance-based seismic engineering.
    In addition, the NIST GCR 09-917-2 report, Research Required to Support Full Implementation
    of Performance-Based Seismic Design (NIST, 2009), also identified the need to
    improve analytical models for buildings and their components in near-collapse
    seismic loading. To help fill this gap, the ATC-114 Project developed a series
    of reports that provide general nonlinear modeling and nonlinear analysis guidance,
    as well as guidance specific to the following two structural systems: structural
    steel moment frames and reinforced concrete moment frames. This Part IIb report,
    referred to as Guidelines herein, provide practical guidance for nonlinear modeling
    and analysis specific to reinforced concrete moment-resisting frames and their
    components. It is a companion to Part I Guidelines (NIST, 2017) that provides
    general guidance on nonlinear analysis. Other Part II companion reports provide
    further details for selected system types.'
