abstract:
- content: Space is a newly emerging commercial critical infrastructure sector that
    is no longer the domain of only national government authorities. Space is an inherently
    risky environment in which to operate, so cybersecurity risks involving commercial
    space – including those affecting commercial satellite vehicles – need to be understood
    and managed alongside other types of risks to ensure safe and successful operations.
    This report provides a general introduction to cybersecurity risk management for
    the commercial satellite industry as they seek to start managing cybersecurity
    risks in space. This document is by no means comprehensive in terms of addressing
    all of the cybersecurity risks to commercial satellite infrastructure, nor does
    it explore risks to satellite vehicles, which may be introduced through the implementation
    of cybersecurity controls. The intent is to present basic concepts, generate discussions,
    and provide sample references for additional information on pertinent cybersecurity
    risk management models.
