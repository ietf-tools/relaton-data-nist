abstract:
- content: This NIST Special Publication (SP) is one in a series of NIST SPs that
    address research needs articulated in the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI)
    Environmental, Health, and Safety Research Strategy published in 2011[1]. This
    Strategy identified a Nanomaterial Measurement Infrastructure (NMI) as essential
    for science-based risk assessment and risk management of nanotechnology-enabled
    products as pertaining to human health, exposure, and the environment. NIST was
    identified as the lead federal agency in the NMI core research area of the Strategy.
    This research area includes development of measurement tools for the detection
    and characterization of engineered nanomaterials in nanotechnology-enabled products.
    Textiles containing silver nanoparticles are consumer products of great interest
    for nanotechnology environmental, health, and safety (nano-EHS) research and for
    product regulation. Detection and characterization of these nanomaterials is a
    focus of this SP The protocol in this SP describes challenges and solutions for
    acquiring and analyzing microscope images of nanoparticles to give particle size
    distributions. An example methodology is also proposed which is designed to be
    high throughput and internally consistent while minimizing the number of subjective
    choices. While this protocol was developed with the AgNP- loaded textile system
    in mind, the strategies described herein could be applied to particles of any
    size, and the required micrographs could be gathered via SEM, TEM, light microscopy,
    or myriad other techniques
