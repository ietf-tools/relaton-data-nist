abstract:
- content: This handbook has been prepared as a procedural guide for the compliance
    testing of net content statements on packaged goods. Compliance testing of packaged
    goods is the determination of the conformance of the- results of the packaging,
    distribution, and retailing process (the packages) to specific legal requirements
    for net content declarations. This handbook has been developed primarily for the
    use of government officials. However, it should also be useful to commercial and
    industrial establishments in the areas of packaging, distribution, and sale of
    commodities. In conducting compliance testing, the conversion of quantity values
    from one measurement system to another (e.g., from the metric system to the avoirdupois
    system) should be handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between
    the accuracy of the data and the number of digits displayed. In all conversions,
    the number of significant digits retained should ensure that accuracy is neither
    sacrificed nor exaggerated. For this 2020 edition of Handbook 133 all dimensions
    for test procedures, devices, or environments have been rounded to two significant
    digits (e.g., 2.5 cm to 1.0 in) or to a precision level applicable to the test
    equipment (e.g., 200 kPa for 25 psi and 35 MPa for 5,000 psi).
