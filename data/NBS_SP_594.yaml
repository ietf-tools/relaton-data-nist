abstract:
- content: These proceedings are the compilation of 203 papers presented at the International
    Conference on Nuclear Cross Sections for Technology, October 22-26, 1979. Invited
    papers reviewed nuclear data needs for standard fission reactors, alternate fuel
    cycles, fusion reactors, biomedical applications, and applications in industry,
    as well as integral experiments, cross section measurements, cross section standards,
    and cross section evaluations. There were 165 contributed papers on these subjects
    with some emphasis on cross section measurement techniques and evaluation of cross
    section data.
