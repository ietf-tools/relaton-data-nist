abstract:
- content: Tropospheric forward scatter circuits have established their place in the
    world-wide communications network of the military and it is the intent of this
    paper to illustrate by a specific example how the performance of a circuit of
    this type may be predicted with adequate accuracy without making costly transmission
    loss measurements over the intended path.
