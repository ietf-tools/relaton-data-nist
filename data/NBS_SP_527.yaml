abstract:
- content: The objective of this symposium was to assess manufacturing technologies
    which could be adapted or developed to provide a competitive advantage for the
    U.S. footwear industry, and to develop a specific plan for activities that would
    be appropriate for government and industry cooperation. The meeting was part of
    a three-year Department of Commerce Program to help restore the growth and vitality
    of the domestic footwear industry. Initial sessions presented technical and evaluative
    information as an input to the subsequent working group discussions of footwear
    industry representatives. Government staff described the results of their assessment
    of the problems and opportunities of the industry. To stimulate constructive dialogue,
    five private research organizations presented ideas and recommendations for future
    footwear technological development resulting from Commerce Department sponsored
    studies. The major new technologies and processes presented addressed materials
    development, leather technologies, customfitting and computer assistance in shoe
    design and manufacture (CAD/CAM). In other presentations, the President of the
    American Footwear Industry Association shared his concerns, a leading footwear
    designer explored design, marketing and the technology interfaces, and representatives
    of technologically advanced industries, (aerospace, automobiles, communications)
    shared their views on manufacturing technologies and applications to footwear
    industry problems. Preliminary symposium results were evidence of industry enthusiasm
    and support for government-industry cooperative activities, interest in establishing
    a footwear center to provide industry-wide technical assistance, and a desire
    to assess computer-aided design and manufacture (CAD/CAM). Reports by the consulting
    firms on new technologies and business strategies for the footwear industry are
    included as appendices.
