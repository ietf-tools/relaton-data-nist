abstract:
- content: 'The IRis EXchange (IREX) program at NIST employs best measurement practices
    to support the development, standardization, and interoperability of iris-based
    technology through ongoing evaluations of that technology; IREX evaluations provide
    information that helps advance the development of a marketplace of iris-based
    applications based on standardized interoperable iris imagery and provides decision
    makers with information critical to their decisions about deployment of the technology.
    IREX has conducted a series of evaluations of iris algorithms which are documented
    on the IREX website at https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/iris-exchange-irex-overview.
    To assure that algorithms submitted for evaluation produce the same results in
    the NIST evaluation environment that they do in the developer/vendor environment,
    we need to compare results on a common set of iris images in the two environments.
    IREX-Validation-2019 is a dataset developed to facilitate such comparisons. In
    brief: The images in the dataset were collected under protocols approved by the
    NIST Institutional Review Board. The images are from subjects who provided model
    releases that permit use of the images in publications and datasets that are distributed
    by NIST. The dataset is distributed under user agreements associated with IREX
    evaluations. Inquiries regarding the IREX program may be directed to the IREX
    Liaison at irex@nist.gov. Any papers or reports making use of the dataset should
    cite this report as discussed in section 2.1 Carried out under NIST IRB Approved
    protocol ITL-16-0002.'
