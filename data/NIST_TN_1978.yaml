abstract:
- content: The behavior of high-strength structural steel bolts at elevated temperatures,
    especially under shear loading, is very limited in the literature. This report
    presents the test results, as well as a reduced order modeling approach of high-strength
    structural bolts subject to double-shear loading at elevated temperatures. First,
    it presents results from a recently conducted experimental study. The parameters
    varied between tests included the bolt grade, bolt diameter, and temperature.
    Bolt grades A325 and A490 were tested. For each bolt grade, three different diameters
    were tested (19 mm (3/4 in), 22 mm (7/8 in), and 25.4 mm (1 in)) at five different
    temperatures (20 °C, 200 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C). At least three tests
    were conducted for each combination of parameters. Degradations in the mechanical
    and material properties including stiffness, strength, and deformation at fracture,
    are characterized and presented. The results from these experiments fill a critical
    knowledge gap currently present in the literature regarding the behavior of high-strength
    structural bolts under shear loading at elevated temperatures. These data will
    ultimately provide a thorough understanding of the overall behavior of structural
    steel systems under realistic fire loading by clarifying the (i) shear behavior
    of high-strength structural steel bolts at elevated temperatures, and (ii) degradation
    in the mechanical and material properties of high-strength steel bolts with increasing
    temperatures. The report then describes the formulation of an empirical component-based
    model for shear behavior of high-strength bolts developed based on the data from
    the double-shear testing of highstrength bolts at elevated temperatures. Such
    component-based models are computationally efficient, facilitating large building-level
    analyses where high-fidelity modeling of the bolts would be infeasible. The component-based
    model is shown to accurately account for the temperature dependent degradation
    of bolt shear strength and stiffness, while also providing the capability to model
    load reversal and bolt-shear rupture.
