abstract:
- content: A compact microwave generator (Fig. 1) is described in which an X-band
    reflex, klystron is stabilized by a quartz-crystal secondary ^standard. Frequency
    stability of the order of several parts in 10 over periods of the order of a day
    has been obtained. A technique for obtaining continuous wide-range variation of
    output frequency with stability of the order of 1 part in 10 is described.
