abstract:
- content: NBS uses a decentralized system for managing the participation of NBS representatives
    in outside standards committee activities. This type of management is governed
    by NBS policy; coordinated through standards offices in each NBS Major Operational
    Unit; and monitored and supported by the Office of Standards Information, Analysis,
    and Development (OSIAD). These reports contain highlights of significant technical
    and individual contributions made by NBS staff, a description of NBS Standards
    management and information activities, and a directory of standards committees
    on which NBS staff serve.
