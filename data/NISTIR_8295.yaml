abstract:
- content: With the newly created Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN),
    the public safety community has a unique opportunity to review and improve communication
    technology for first responders, 9-1-1 communications, emergency medical services
    (EMS), fire, and law enforcement. Understanding the problems and challenges currently
    experienced by first responders provides the basis for addressing and developing
    solutions to improve public safety communication. The National Institute of Standards
    and Technology Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) usability team conducted
    indepth interviews with approximately 200 first responders representing 13 states
    in eight Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regions across the United
    States. From this larger dataset, this report, the fourth volume in the series,
    focuses on the contexts and challenges specifically facing 9-1-1 communications
    personnel. The findings reported here stem from 30 interviews with public safety
    answering point responders. A qualitative analysis of the transcribed interview
    data revealed unique issues resulting from significantly different contexts and
    primary tasks of communications personnel in contrast to first responders from
    other disciplines. Challenges include 9-1-1 incoming calls from wireless devices,
    continuity of operations related issues, as well as, technology implementation
    and infrastructure problems. Communications personnel are concerned that new technologies
    will demand additional focus which will increase their cognitive loads. Just like
    their colleaguesin other emergency response disciplines, communications personnel
    stressed the need for utility in technology that emphasizes usability, interoperability,
    and reliability. Understanding the specific challenges faced by communication
    personnel can provide insight into the types of new technology, as well as technology
    improvements, to help them best respond to incidents effectively and efficiently.
