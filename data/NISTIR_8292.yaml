abstract:
- content: The FRVT MORPH test provides ongoing independent testing of prototype face
    morphing attack detection (MAD) technologies. The evaluation is designed to obtain
    commonly measured assessment of morph detection capability to inform developers
    and current and prospective end-users. FRVT MORPH is open for ongoing participation
    worldwide, and there is no charge to participate. The test leverages a number
    of datasets created using different morphing methods with goals to evaluate algorithm
    performance over a large spectrum of morphing techniques. Testing was conducted
    using a tiered approach, where algorithms were evaluated on low quality morphs
    created with readily accessible tools available to non-experts, morphs generated
    using automated morphing methods based on academic research, and high quality
    morphs created using commercial- grade tools. We'd like to get an assessment on
    the existence and extent of morph detection capabilities, and if there is indication
    of high accuracy, much larger datasets can be curated to support large-scale evaluation
    of the technology.
