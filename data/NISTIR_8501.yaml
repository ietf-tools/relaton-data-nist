abstract:
- content: This report of the Semiconductors and Microelectronics Working Group of
    the Interagency Committee on Standards Policy (ICSP) provides an overview of Federal
    government semiconductors and microelectronics standards activities and recommends
    standards focus areas and priorities for ICSP consideration. The Recommendations
    to the ICSP for Strategic Standards Priority Areas section of the report lists
    the current Standards Development Organizations in which the Federal government
    participates that are related to semiconductors and microelectronics, identifies
    five focus areas and priorities, and identifies gaps and opportunities for possible
    impacts in the future. The landscape review section provides an overview of each
    contributing agencyâ€™s relevant semiconductors and microelectronics standards activities,
    including its mission, semiconductors and microelectronics goals, participation
    in standards development organizations, semiconductors and microelectronics focus
    areas and priorities, and semiconductors and microelectronics gaps and opportunities.
    The National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology Strategy
    shows how the Semiconductors and Microelectronics Working Group aligns with the
    National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology.
