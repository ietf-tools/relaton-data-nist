abstract:
- content: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is widely used for the measurement of
    dimensions of nanostructures. This document describes the calibration of SEM magnification
    using the ASTM E766-14 practice with NIST Reference Material (RM) 8820 and the
    calculation of dimensional uncertainty in the use of the calibrated SEM to measure
    dimensions of a fabricated nanostructure. The dimensional measurements are part
    of NIST Special Test 15510S.
