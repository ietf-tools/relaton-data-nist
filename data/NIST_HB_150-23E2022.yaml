abstract:
- content: 'NIST Handbook 150-23 presents the technical requirements and guidance
    for the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory
    Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Homeland Security Applications: Radiation Detection
    Instruments (RDI) program. It is intended for information and use by accredited
    laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation, laboratory accreditation systems,
    users of laboratory services, and others needing information on the requirements
    for accreditation under this program. The 2022 edition of NIST Handbook 150-23
    incorporates changes resulting primarily to include reference to the International
    Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards used for detection of illicit trafficking
    of radioactive materials. Also, the numbering of the handbook has also been restructured
    to reflect that is used by ISO/IEC17025:2017, General requirements for the competence
    of testing and calibration laboratories, as well as editorial improvements. The
    requirements of NIST Handbook 150, the interpretations and specific requirements
    in NIST Handbook 150-23, and the requirements in program-specific checklists (if
    applicable) must be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the
    NVLAP RDI program. For more information, visit the NVLAP website.'
