abstract:
- content: This Guide Brief offers suggestions for short-term implementation tasks,
    as well as short-term activities, that support continual engagement during the
    overall planning process. Implementing short-term administrative solutions can
    help improve resilience and provide community benefits until longer-term solutions
    are implemented.
