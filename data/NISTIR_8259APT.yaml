abstract:
- content: Device cybersecurity capabilities are cybersecurity features or functions
    that computing devices provide through their own technical means (i.e., device
    hardware and software). This publication defines an Internet of Things (IoT) device
    cybersecurity capability core baseline, which is a set of device capabilities
    generally needed to support common cybersecurity controls that protect an organization
    s devices as well as device data, systems, and ecosystems. The purpose of this
    publication is to provide organizations a starting point to use in identifying
    the device cybersecurity capabilities for new IoT devices they will manufacture,
    integrate, or acquire. This publication can be used in conjunction with NISTIR
    8259, Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for IoT Device Manufacturers.
