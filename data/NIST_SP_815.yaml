abstract:
- content: The directory is a guide to laboratory accreditation and similar types
    of programs conducted by state and local government agencies. These programs accredit
    or designate laboratories or other entities to conduct testing to assist the agencies
    in carrying out their responsibilities. The accreditation or designation is based
    on some type of assessment regarding the capability of the laboratory to conduct
    the testing. However, the nature of such assessments varies considerably from
    agency to agency. Entries in the directory are based primarily on information
    provided by each state and local government agency and reflect the agency's view
    of its activities.
