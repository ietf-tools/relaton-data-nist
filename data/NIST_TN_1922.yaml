abstract:
- content: Executive Order 13717 signed by President Obama on 2-2-2016 required NIST
    to draft Implementation Guidelines for Federal agencies to implement the requirements
    of the EO. This document provides suggested approaches for agencies to address
    the EO requirements - the document is advisory only. The Guidelines have been
    extensively reviewed by NIST technical staff, NIST Counsel, the Federal agencies
    represented on the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC),
    the National Security Council technical staff and Council's office. A formal Critical
    Infrastructure Security and Resilience (CISR) review was conducted in November.
