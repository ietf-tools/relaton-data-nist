- content: Manufacturing USA is a network of public-private partnerships united to
    secure U.S. global leadership in advanced manufacturing through large scale collaboration
    on technology, supply chain, and workforce development. The network includes the
    U.S. Departments of Commerce (DOC), Defense (DoD), and Energy (DOE), 16 manufacturing
    innovation institutes and six other federal partner agencies - NASA, NSF, HHS,
    and the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Labor. Together, they work towards
    accomplishing national manufacturing objectives to secure America's future through
    manufacturing innovation, education, and collaboration. This report provides a
    summary of the technology innovation and workforce development projects involving
    the institutes and their 2,300 member organizations during Fiscal Year 2021.
