abstract:
- content: The potential for organizations to capture value from Big Data improves
    every day as the pace of the Big Data revolution continues to increase, but the
    level of value captured by companies deploying Big Data initiatives has not been
    equivalent across all industries. Most companies are struggling to capture a small
    fraction of the available potential in Big Data initiatives. The healthcare and
    manufacturing industries, for example, have so far been less successful at taking
    advantage of data and analytics than other industries such as logistics and retail.
    Effective capture of value will likely require organizational investment in change
    management strategies that support transformation of the culture, and redesign
    of legacy processes. In some cases, the less-than-satisfying impacts of Big Data
    projects are not for lack of significant financial investments in new technology.
    It is common to find reports pointing to a shortage of technical talent as one
    of the largest barriers to undertaking projects, and this issue is expected to
    persist into the future. This volume explores the adoption of Big Data systems
    and barriers to adoption; factors in maturity of Big Data projects, organizations
    implementing those projects, and the Big Data technology market; and considerations
    for implementation and modernization of Big Data systems.
