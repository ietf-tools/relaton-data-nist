abstract:
- content: The Polymer Surface/Interface (PSI) consortium held a two-day workshop
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg,
    MD on October 17th & 18th, 2018 titled, 'The development of characterization tools,
    test methods, modeling approaches, and improvement of environmental stress simulation
    for plastics, coatings, interfaces, and composites.' Day 1 of the workshop was
    open to PSI members, prospective industrial partners, and the general NIST community.
    It was structured around invited speakers and short presentations (10-15 minutes
    in length) in the morning, followed by two open panel discussions in the afternoon.
    Day 2 of the workshop was reserved for PSI business for consortium members and
    interested prospective members only. Participants in this workshop included PSI's
    present members (NIST Engineering Laboratory, Eastman Chemical, Anton Paar, The
    Boeing Co. (invited but unable to attend), Dow Chemical, SABIC, and Saint-Gobain)
    as well as prospective industrial partners. The purpose of this workshop, as articulated
    to members and invitees, was to identify research gaps and delineate future needs
    through (1) discussion of the current state of the science for service life prediction
    (SLP) of polymeric systems exposed to environmental stresses; (2) exchange of
    recent developments in characterization tools, test methods, modeling approaches,
    and environmental stress simulation for plastics, coatings, interfaces, and composites;
    and (3) facilitation of industrial collaborations with NIST to establish weathering
    correlations on industrial-relevant chemistries and exposure sites/conditions
    in conjunction with SPHERE exposure experiments. The purpose of this report is
    to both summarize the broad array of topics presented, as well as communicate
    the major themes, research needs, and future technological and collaborative directions
    covered during the panel discussions.
