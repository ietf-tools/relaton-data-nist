abstract:
- content: In the framework of a collaborative project between ASME, NASA, and NIST,
    instrumented Charpy tests have been performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (77
    K, or 196 C) on specimens extracted from the center of four 316L welded stainless
    steel plates, each produced by a different vendor. Although the plates were produced
    in accordance with the same specifications from the same material (316L), clear
    differences in impact toughness have been observed, with the toughest welded plate
    exhibiting more than twice the absorbed energy of the least tough. Besides impact
    toughness, the availability of instrumented Charpy data has also allowed deriving
    estimates of dynamic yield strength and shear fracture appearance.
