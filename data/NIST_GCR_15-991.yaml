abstract:
- content: This document provides a recommended practice for representing electronic
    component property data in accordance with ISO 10303-210:2014. It takes into account
    recent extensions to the EXPRESS schema in that standard and provides illustrations
    and examples of a typical use case of an integrated circuit amplifier. Example
    instance data is provided. Detailed examples are providing illustrating construction
    methodology for composing SI derived units commonly used in electronic component
    data sheets and catalogs. An example illustrating construction methodology for
    tabular data is provided. Several detailed examples have been generated demonstrating
    the population of a number of common characteristics using a variety of both SI
    base and derived units.
