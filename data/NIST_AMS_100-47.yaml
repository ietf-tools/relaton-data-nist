abstract:
- content: 'In 2020, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee
    on Advanced Manufacturing and Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial
    Intelligence articulated cross-agency interest in the value and timeliness of
    organizing a symposium to outline benefits of AI adoption in manufacturing and
    identify issues that inhibit widescale adoption. In response, the National Science
    Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    sponsored a three-workshop Symposium entitled Strategy for Resilient Manufacturing
    Ecosystems Through Artificial Intelligence (AI) to seek input from industry, academia,
    and government experts. The workshops focused on potential roles of each sector
    in performing research and development (R&D) and ideas for implementation of AI
    in manufacturing that could inform the development of the U.S. Advanced Manufacturing
    strategic plan. This paper documents the Symposium recommendations with a roadmap
    organized to overcome the current lack of industry tools, trust, confidence, and
    experience with industry R&D focused on the barriers to AI scaling and deployment.
    There are eight specific recommendations for collaborative actions by industry,
    government, and academia: 1. Establish new and/or expanded Public Private Partnerships
    (PPPs) to facilitate a broad range of R&D. 2. Research, develop, and demonstrate
    advanced software tools, models, and infrastructure for AI/ML implementation and
    scale-up in manufacturing. 3. Establish programs that achieve industry collaboration
    on an integrated and trusted set of shared capabilities. 4. Initiate R&D to enable
    industry-wide scaling and deployment of AI applications in manufacturing. 5. Educate
    and train a digital-savvy manufacturing workforce with software and hardware tools
    needed to deploy and scale the use of data and AI with trust and confidence. 6.
    Enable digital capabilities at small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs). 7.
    Incentivize AI adoption throughout established supply chains. 8. Promote new business
    models for AI adoption. As this adoption cycle takes hold, the market-driven forces
    of entrepreneurship and investment capital will ultimately lead to industry-wide
    adoption of AI technology, and the U.S. manufacturing industry will be on its
    way to achieving global leadership and resilient supply chains.'
