abstract:
- content: Many organizations employees and contractors use enterprise telework technologies
    to perform work from external locations. Most teleworkers use remote access technologies
    to interface with an organization's non-public computing resources. The nature
    of telework and remote access technologies permitting access to protected resources
    from external networks and often external hosts as well generally places them
    at higher risk than similar technologies only accessed from inside the organization,
    as well as increasing the risk to the internal resources made available to teleworkers
    through remote access. This publication provides information on security considerations
    for several types of remote access solutions, and it makes recommendations for
    securing a variety of telework and remote access technologies. It also gives advice
    on creating telework security policies.
