abstract:
- content: In this paper we set out to identify which risk profiles contribute most
    to deaths in disasters. A risk profile represents an identifiable group of people
    who would be at risk of death in a disaster through some mechanism. Four risk
    profiles were considered in this report, Population (representing the overall
    population of a location), Frailty (representing people who are in some sense
    physically vulnerable to injury or illness), Mobile Homes residents, and Risk
    Takers (proxied by the population of heavy drinkers). Overall the single greatest
    contributor to deaths was the Mobile Home risk profile, although that varied by
    disaster event type. The prominence of the mobile-home risk profile suggests that
    in many cases it proxies for a larger group, possibly related to income or educational
    level. The risk profile associated with disaster fatalities depends on the type
    of event. For Katrina-type hurricanes and extreme-temperature events, frailty
    was the most important risk profile. For wind and flood events the Mobile Home
    population was overwhelmingly the most significant risk profile. For avalanche
    events the Risk-Taker profile was the most significant one. For all other event
    types (including non-Katrina hurricanes) fatalities were attributed to a mix of
    the Mobile Home and Frailty risk profiles. Disaster-related deaths do not appear
    to strike people at random from the population as a whole. Looking at the county-level
    results, there are identifiable spatial patterns to the risk profiles. High frailty
    clusters tend to be found around high population regions, while high mobile home
    clusters are in more rural areas. Much of the U.S., spatially, is in a moderate
    cluster both for frailty and mobile homes, while most major population centers
    are part of clusters of similar values for risk profile.
