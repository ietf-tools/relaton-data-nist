abstract:
- content: Modern computers rely on fundamental system firmware, commonly known as
    the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), to facilitate the hardware initialization
    process and transition control to the hypervisor or operating system. Unauthorized
    modification of BIOS firmware by malicious software constitutes a significant
    threat because of the BIOS⁰₉s unique and privileged position within the PC architecture.
    The guidelines in this document include requirements on servers to mitigate the
    execution of malicious or corrupt BIOS code. They apply to BIOS firmware stored
    in the BIOS flash, including the BIOS code, the cryptographic keys that are part
    of the Root of Trust for Update, and static BIOS data. This guide is intended
    to provide server platform vendors with recommendations and guidelines for a secure
    BIOS update process.
