abstract:
- content: This paper describes a reduced-order modeling approach for thermal analyses
    of composite slabs with profiled decking. The reduced-order modeling approach
    consists of alternating strips of layered shell elements, representing the thick
    and thin portions of slab. Layered shell elements representing the thick portion
    of the slab adopt a linear reduction in the density of concrete within the rib
    to account for the tapered profile of the ribs. A dummy material with low specific
    heat and high through-thickness thermal conductivity is used to represent the
    voids between the ribs. The specific heat of concrete in the rib is also modified
    to indirectly consider the heat input through the web of the decking. The optimal
    ratio of modified to actual specific heat of concrete in the rib is determined,
    depending on the ratio of the height of the upper continuous portion to the height
    of the rib. The reduced-order modeling approach is validated against experimental
    results.
