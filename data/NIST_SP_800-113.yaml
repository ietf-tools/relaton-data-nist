abstract:
- content: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide users
    with secure remote access to an organization's resources. An SSL VPN consists
    of one or more VPN devices to which users connect using their Web browsers. The
    traffic between the Web browser and SSL VPN device is encrypted with the SSL protocol.
    SSL VPNs can provide remote users with access to Web applications and client/server
    applications, as well as connectivity to internal networks. They offer versatility
    and ease of use because they use the SSL protocol, which is included with all
    standard Web browsers, so special client configuration or installation is often
    not required. In planning a VPN deployment, many organizations are faced with
    a choice between an IPsec-based VPN and an SSL-based VPN. This document seeks
    to assist organizations in understanding SSL VPN technologies. The publication
    also makes recommendations for designing, implementing, configuring, securing,
    monitoring, and maintaining SSL VPN solutions. SP 800-113 provides a phased approach
    to SSL VPN planning and implementation that can help in achieving successful SSL
    VPN deployments. It also includes a comparison with other similar technologies
    such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPNs and other VPN solutions.
