abstract:
- content: 'FIPS 201 establishes a standard for a Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
    system (Standard) that meets the control and security objectives of Homeland Security
    Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12). It is based on secure and reliable forms
    of identity credentials issued by the Federal Government to its employees and
    contractors. These credentials are used by mechanisms that authenticate individuals
    who require access to federally controlled facilities, information systems, and
    applications. This Standard addresses requirements for initial identity proofing,
    infrastructure to support interoperability of identity credentials, and accreditation
    of organizations issuing PIV credentials. [Supersedes FIPS 201-2 (August 2013
