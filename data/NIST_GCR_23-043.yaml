abstract:
- content: 'Accreditation is a formal recognition by an independent third party/accreditation
    body that a forensic service provider such as a laboratory, unit, or agency,a
    meets standards. A standard is a requirement or guideline used to ensure that
    a process or service, in this case Crime Scene Investigation (CSI), is conducted
    consistently within the forensic service provider by competent personnel and is
    fit for purpose. Forensic service providers are accredited to ISO/IEC 17020, ISO/IEC
    17025 and any other relevant sector-specific standards. The accreditation process
    involves an audit, or assessment, which, when performed, evaluates the unit against
    one or both of these standards to ensure it has developed and maintains a quality
    system that aligns with the requirements in an ISO standard. The 2009 National
    Academy of Sciences (NAS) report, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United
    States: A Path Forward, recommended mandatory accreditation and quality control
    and quality assurance programs for all units or laboratories that conduct forensic
    science activities, including those in which police agencies and identification
    units engage. Accreditation of CSI Units is important because it provides assurances
    that quality standards are met during scene investigations—the main gateway for
    recognizing, recording, collecting, transporting, and storing forensic evidence,
    which can have a lasting impact on the analysis, interpretation, reporting of
    results, and ultimately, the outcome of the investigation. Accreditation gives
    the criminal justice system and the public confidence in a unit’s competence and
    results and ensures that the unit has policies and procedures in place and can
    demonstrate the unit maintains impartiality. This is particularly important in
    the practice of crime scene investigation and forensic science because unlike
    other industries, there is no nationally mandatory regulatory approach to ensuring
    quality. Therefore, a voluntary standardization approach through accreditation
    is important for maintaining public trust, transparency, and quality of work.
    This report reviews the steps a CSI Unit must take to achieve accreditation, discusses
    the documentation framework that comprises a quality management system, and provides
    guidance to meet the requirements in ISO/IEC 17020 and ISO/IEC 17025 and any additional
    requirements included in amplification documents.'
