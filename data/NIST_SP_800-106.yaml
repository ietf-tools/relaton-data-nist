abstract:
- content: NIST-approved digital signature algorithms require the use of an approved
    cryptographic hash function in the generation and verification of signatures.
    Approved cryptographic hash functions and digital signature algorithms can be
    found in FIPS 180-3, Secure Hash Standard (SHS), and FIPS 186-3, Digital Signature
    Standard (DSS), respectively. The security provided by the cryptographic hash
    function is vital to the security of a digital signature application. This Recommendation
    specifies a method to enhance the security of the cryptographic hash functions
    used in digital signature applications by randomizing the messages that are signed.
