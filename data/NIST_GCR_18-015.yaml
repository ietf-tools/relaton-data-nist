abstract:
- content: Industrial practice is in a state of transition, away from the use of drawings
    towards the use of annotated 3D CAD models as a means of communication. Working
    as a representation of an object or a system, a model-based product definition
    (MBD) is used to communicate information inside of a model-based enterprise (MBE).
    Such an enterprise will find itself in a transitional state as well, moving away
    from paper-based information sharing towards the use of model-based, digital product
    data. This research investigation sought to identify the minimum information model
    (MIM) -- the information elements necessary within an MBD to effectively employ
    a model as a replacement for a technical drawing in specific workflows in the
    product lifecycle. Over the course of this investigation, another phenomenon emerged
    -- the common information model (CIM), which represents those information items
    that are necessary for the workflows targeted in this study. As expounded upon
    later in this report, the impacts of contextual domain knowledge on the implementation
    of the common information model is what formed the minimum information model discovered
    in this project.
