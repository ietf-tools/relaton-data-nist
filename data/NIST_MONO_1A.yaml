abstract:
- content: This report describes how the fires that followed the impact of debris
    from the collapse of WTC 1 (the north tower) led to the collapse of WTC 7; an
    evaluation of the building evacuation and emergency response procedures; what
    procedures and practices were used in the design, construction, operation, and
    maintenance of the building; and areas in current building and fire codes, standards,
    and practices that warrant revision. Also in this report is a summary of how NIST
    reached its conclusions. NIST complemented in-house expertise with private sector
    technical experts; accumulated copious documents, photographs, and videos of the
    disaster; conducted first- person interviews of building occupants and emergency
    responders; analyzed the evacuation and emergency response operations in and around
    WTC 7; performed computer simulations of the behavior of WTC 7 on September 11,
    2001; and combined the knowledge gained into a probable collapse sequence. The
    report concludes with a list of 13 recommendations for action in the areas of
    increased structural integrity, enhanced fire endurance of structures, new methods
    for fire resistant design of structures, enhanced active fire protection, improved
    emergency response, improved procedures and practices, and education and training.
    One of these is new; the other 12 are reiterated from the investigation into the
    collapse of the towers. Each of the 13 is relevant to WTC 7.
