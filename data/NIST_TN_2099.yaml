abstract:
- content: The Additive Manufacturing Metrology Testbed (AMMT) is a fully customized
    laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM) research platform designed
    and constructed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This system
    incorporates a galvanometer (galvo) scanner, consisting of two mirrors which can
    be controlled to rotate over fixed angles and reflect and position a focused,
    high power laser onto a substrate. This Technical Note describes the methods for
    calibrating the quasi-static position of the laser spot, positioned via the galvo,
    as a function of the digital command to the galvo controller. In addition, the
    procedures for calibrating the galvo position encoders to the physical laser spot
    position are provided. An example is provided of measured galvo position errors
    before and after calibration and compensation. Finally, an error reporting and
    uncertainty budget is provided.
