abstract:
- content: ASTM E 2187 has become the internationally referenced standard for designing
    and specifying less fire-prone cigarettes. In this test method, a lit cigarette
    is laid on multiple layers of filter paper, and the observer identifies whether
    the cigarette burns its full length or not. Historically, a specific brand of
    filter paper has been used as the test substrate, with specified ranges of mass
    and moisture uptake necessary to achieve reasonable repeatability and reproducibility
    of the test results. This approach became less viable when the manufacture of
    the paper was moved to a different plant, and when an increased demand for the
    paper resulted in long delays in delivery. This Technical Note describes an interlaboratory
    study (ILS) of an alternate substrate composed of a thin sheet of full hard 302
    stainless steel and a single sheet of filter paper. Seven laboratories examined
    the effect of filter paper from four manufacturers and steel from three manufacturers
    on the test results for four cigarette designs. The findings of the ILS were (1)
    that the ignition propensity results obtained using the steel/paper substrates
    were not statistically distinguishable from the result obtained for testing on
    10 layers of the original filter paper, (2) there were no statistically significant
    effects of the substrate materials on the test results, for those combinations
    of cigarette, paper, and steel, and (3) the filter paper manufactured in the new
    plant gives test results that are more than a factor of two lower than the results
    from the original plant.
