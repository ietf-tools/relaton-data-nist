abstract:
- content: This volume introduces concepts to support automated assessment of most
    of the security controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53. Referencing
    SP 800-53A, the controls are divided into more granular parts (determination statements)
    to be assessed. The parts of the control assessed by each determination statement
    are called control items. The control items are then grouped into the appropriate
    security capabilities. As suggested by SP 800-53 Revision 4, security capabilities
    are groups of controls that support a common purpose. For effective automated
    assessment, testable defect checks are defined that bridge the determination statements
    to the broader security capabilities to be achieved and to the SP 800-53 security
    control items themselves. The defect checks correspond to security sub-capabilities
    -- called sub-capabilities because each is part of a larger capability. Capabilities
    and sub-capabilities are both designed with the purpose of addressing a series
    of attack steps. Automated assessments (in the form of defect checks) are performed
    using the test assessment method defined in SP 800-53A by comparing a desired
    and actual state (or behavior).
