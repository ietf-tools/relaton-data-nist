    Division has collected data detailing the performance measurement of a mobile
    manipulator, i.e., an automatic guided vehicle (AGV) with onboard robot arm from
    two different manufacturers. The performance measurement concept uses a novel
    artifact and method that is verified using an optical tracking system (OTS) to
    measure the AGV and manipulator motion and position uncertainty. Associated data
    from each of the three systems (AGV, manipulator, and OTS) was collected during
    two tests and all tests have corresponding timestamps relative to global positioning
    system (GPS) time, where the computer clocks are synchronized using the Network
    Time Protocol. This paper provides detailed explanation of the data from mobile
    manipulator performance measurement tests.
