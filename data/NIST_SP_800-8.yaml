abstract:
- content: The Database Language SQL (SQL) is a standard interface for accessing and
    manipulating relational databases. An SQL-compliant database management system
    (DBMS) will include a minimum level of functionality in a variety of areas. However,
    many additional areas are left unspecified by the SQL standard. In addition, there
    are multiple versions of the SQL standard; the functionality will vary according
    to the particular version. This document examines the security functionality that
    might be required of relational DBMS's, and compares them with the requirements
    and options of the SQL specifications. The comparison will show that the security
    functionality of an SQL-compliant DBMS may vary greatly. A variety of security
    policies are considered which can be supported by SQL. The document ends by showing
    which types of functions are required by the examined security policies.
