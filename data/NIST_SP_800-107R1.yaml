abstract:
- content: Hash functions that compute a fixed-length message digest from arbitrary
    length messages are widely used for many purposes in information security. This
    document provides security guidelines for achieving the required or desired security
    strengths when using cryptographic applications that employ the approved hash
    functions specified in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-4. These
    include functions such as digital signatures, Keyed-hash Message Authentication
    Codes (HMACs) and Hash-based Key Derivation Functions (Hash-based KDFs).
