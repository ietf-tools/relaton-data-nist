abstract:
- content: This report documents the design and construction of a reduced-scale compartment
    and summary data for a set of gaseous fuel experiments to study the backdraft
    phenomenon. In these experiments, a fire was enclosed in a compartment with modified
    configurations (e.g., fire size, fuel-off time, spark ignition location, spark
    delay time, and front opening) to identify precursors to a backdraft event. A
    moderate fire size of 25 kW was studied using methane, propane, and propene as
    individual fuels. A 16.7 kW propane fire and 37.5 kW methane fire were also studied.
    Temperature readings in the upper and lower layers of the compartment, pressure,
    external heat flux measurements, and heat flux measurements at the compartment
    floor were recorded during each experiment. For experiments where a backdraft
    occurred, flame size measurements and ignition times relative to the doorway opening
    were obtained from video recordings during the experiments. Experiments were repeated
    at least once for each set of selected experimental conditions. Fuel flow conditions
    for each fuel and fire size produced events ranging from no ignition to backdrafts
    for the range of compartment configurations studied. In general, the transition
    from no ignition to increasingly larger backdrafts was observed for each fuel
    as its flow time was increased.
