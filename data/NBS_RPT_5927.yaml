abstract:
- content: Transient temperature distribution histories, thermal stresses, and deflections
    were computed for 13 box beams uniformly heated along one cover. Various heating
    rates, geometries of beam cross-section, and thermal properties were considered.
    Heat transfer was by radiation and conduction. Gaseous heat transfer and possible
    effects of yielding, creep, and buckling were neglected. For maximum beam temperatures
    above 700-900¿̐¿ F, change in emissivity of the interior surfaces of the beam
    had an appreciable effect on the cover (but not the web) temperatures and, to
    an even greater extent, on the beam deflection. At maximum beam temperatures of
    1200¿̐¿ F, an increase in interior surface emissivity caused an appreciable decrease
    of the maximum thermal stress. A rough experimental check of temperature distri¿̐¿
    bution and beam deflection was made for one case.
