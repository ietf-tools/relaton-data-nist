abstract:
- content: 'Following an open meeting entitled, Hydrocarbon Chemistry QA/QC, at the
    2014 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill and Ecosystem Science Conference in Mobile, Alabama,
    the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) initiated the Hydrocarbon Intercalibration
    Experiment (HIE) [1]. The goal of this effort was to address the importance of
    laboratory quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) practices and to promote
    participation in quality assurance programs for hydrocarbon compounds. Over thirty
    laboratories expressed interest in participation in the Hydrocarbon Intercalibration
    Experiment. These laboratories were supplied with two petroleum crude oil samples
    provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): Standard
    Reference Material (SRM) 2779 Gulf of Mexico Crude Oil [2], and candidate SRM
    2777 Weathered Gulf of Mexico Oil. SRM 2779 was prepared from neat oil collected
    directly from the leaking Macondo well during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill
    event, and candidate SRM 2777 is a field-weathered residue of the Macondo well
    oil dissolved in toluene. Twenty laboratories submitted results on traditional
    analytes (that included saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and biomarkers)
    measured by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry or flame ionization
    detection. The results for select hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and biomarkers
    from this intercomparison exercise are reported along with a summary of the analytical
    methods used.'
