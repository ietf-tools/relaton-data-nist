abstract:
- content: In April 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)
    held a dry run for the data collection portion of its Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint
    Challenge. This data collection event was designed to ensure that the real data
    collection event held in September 2017 would be successful. To this end, real
    biometric data from unhabituated individuals needed to be collected. The National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of IARPA, has released
    a dataset of the biometric images obtained during the N2N Fingerprint Challenge
    dry run data collection. The image distribution, entitled Special Database 301
    (SD 301), can be freely downloaded from the NIST website.
