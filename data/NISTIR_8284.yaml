abstract:
- content: From September to November 2018, the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) partnered with the National Association of Regulatory Utility
    Commissioners (NARUC) to hold a series of roundtable meetings to support the revision
    of its Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards (hereafter
    the Framework). The Framework addresses the increasingly important ability to
    exchange actionable information between devices and organizations.
