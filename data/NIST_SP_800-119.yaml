abstract:
- content: 'Due to the exhaustion of IPv4 address space, and the Office of Management
    and Budget (OMB) mandate that U.S. federal agencies begin to use the IPv6 protocol,
    NIST undertook the development of a guide to help educate federal agencies about
    the possible security risks during their initial IPv6 deployment. Since IPv6 is
    not backwards compatible with IPv4, organizations will have to change their network
    infrastructure and systems to deploy IPv6. Organizations should begin now to understand
    the risks of deploying IPv6, as well as strategies to mitigate such risks. Detailed
    planning will enable an organization to navigate the process smoothly and securely.
    This document provides guidelines for organizations to aid in securely deploying
    IPv6. The goals of this document are to: educate the reader about IPv6 features
    and the security impacts of those features; provide a comprehensive survey of
    mechanisms that can be used for the deployment of IPv6; and provide a suggested
    deployment strategy for moving to an IPv6 environment. After reviewing this document,
    the reader should have a reasonable understanding of IPv6 and how it compares
    to IPv4, security impacts of IPv6 features and capabilities, as-yet unknown impacts
    of IPv6 deployment, and increased knowledge and awareness about the range of IPv4
    to IPv6 transition mechanisms.'
