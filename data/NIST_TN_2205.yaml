abstract:
- content: In the last twenty years, wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires have been
    growing in severity and size. The structures destroyed by WUI fires have devastated
    entire communities and have cost billions of dollars while significantly impacting
    the social fabric and economic well-being of entire regions. Structural losses
    have been attributed to exposures from embers (firebrands) and fire (radiation
    and/or convection). As structural losses continue to increase, there is need for
    a comprehensive hazard assessment and mitigation methodology to harden appropriate
    structures and parcels effectively and efficiently against ember and fire exposures.
    The Hazard Mitigation Methodology (HMM) described in this report was developed
    explicitly to meet these needs. The science-based methodology uses the knowledge
    collected from post-fire field observations spanning over a dozen years and tens
    of thousands of hours of field data integration and analysis. Additionally, the
    HMM utilizes the latest technical knowledge gained from laboratory and large-scale
    research in fire propagation and hazard mitigation in the WUI. The HMM is the
    result of a sixteen-month collaborative effort between NIST, the California Department
    of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), and the Insurance Institute for Business
    and Home Safety (IBHS). The HMM is a spatial hazard mitigation methodology that
    provides an implementable path forward by considering the spatial relationships
    of fuels and exposures and hardening at the structure and parcel levels. The HMM
    demonstrates how complex structure hardening is, and how and why hazards associated
    with both fire and ember exposures need to be mitigated. The methodology further
    demonstrates where structure hardening in the absence of parcel hardening does
    not work by highlighting the relationships between exposure and hardening. Housing
    density, structure separation distance, and parcel layouts are also addressed.
    The methodology was explicitly designed to address the current building stock,
    i.e., to solve the retrofit challenges, and efforts were made to limit retrofit
    expenses. While the methodology was developed primarily for retrofits, the presented
    strategy can also be applied to new construction. This report documents the methodology
    and addresses the critical issues of mitigation effectiveness at the parcel and
    community levels. The impacts of partial mitigation at the parcel and community
    level were addressed for different types of WUI communities.
