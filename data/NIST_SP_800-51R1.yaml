abstract:
- content: 'This publication provides recommendations for using two vulnerability
    naming schemes: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Configuration
    Enumeration (CCE). SP 800-51 Revision 1 gives an introduction to both naming schemes
    and makes recommendations for end-user organizations on using their names. The
    publication also presents recommendations for software and service vendors on
    how they should use vulnerability names and naming schemes in their product and
    service offerings.'
