abstract:
- content: Currently, global economies are using resources and contaminating resources
    faster than they can be regenerated. This resource depletion strains the economy
    and society today and into the future and is largely due to a series of misaligned
    incentives. Solving this problem begins by identifying these misalignments, identifying
    feasible solutions that realign incentives or addresses the results of the misalignment.
    This report examines the economics of a circular economy, focusing on standards
    and technologies that might facilitate increased environmental sustainability.
