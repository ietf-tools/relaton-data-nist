abstract:
- content: Presidential Executive Order 13717 (EO 13717), Establishing a Federal Earthquake
    Risk Management Standard, encourages federal agencies to enhance resilience...[to]
    future earthquakes by evaluating and retrofitting existing federal buildings based
    on current existing building codes. However, while guidance on evaluation and
    retrofit practices is readily available, a standard approach to estimating retrofit
    costs does not exist. Moreover, the absence of easily obtainable estimates can
    make retrofits prohibitive for decision-makers. This paper develops a cost-estimating
    methodology for seismic retrofits that (1) captures the essential factors that
    drive seismic retrofit costs, such as building construction and square footage;
    and (2) is reproducible using data available to decision-makers. The methodology
    builds on FEMA 156 and 157, Typical Costs for Seismic Rehabilitation of Existing
    Buildings, Volumes 1 and 2. A series of regression models is fit to the data used
    for the FEMA reports, with the models varying in the level of data required; e.g.,
    a decision-maker may not have information on building construction for each asset
    in their inventory. Thus, the trade-off from estimating retrofit costs subject
    to data limitations can be quantified in terms of prediction error, providing
    decision-makers with a set of options for estimating costs together with a measure
    of predictive performance. We find that a simple model, in terms of data requirements,
    can deliver reliable predictions.
