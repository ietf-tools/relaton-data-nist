abstract:
- content: Public safety practitioners utilizing the forthcoming Nationwide Public
    Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) will have smartphones, tablets, and wearables
    at their disposal. Although these devices should enable first responders to complete
    their missions, any influx of new technologies will introduce new security vulnerabilities.
    This document analyzes the needs of public safety mobile devices and wearables
    from a cybersecurity perspective, specifically for the fire service, emergency
    medical service (EMS), and law enforcement. To accomplish this goal, cybersecurity
    use cases were analyzed, previously known attacks against related systems were
    reviewed, and a threat model was created. The overarching goal of this work is
    to identify security objectives for these devices, enabling jurisdictions to more
    easily select and purchase secure devices and industry to design and build more
    secure public safety devices.
