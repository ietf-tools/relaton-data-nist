abstract:
- content: 'Public safety is in the midst of a major transition in the communication
    technology that they use due to the ongoing development and deployment of the
    Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). Once established, the NPSBN
    will provide dedicated broadband to first responders. Having a dedicated network
    will allow first responders to leverage technology in performing their jobs safely,
    effectively, and efficiently. To fully recognize the benefits of having such a
    network, there has been many efforts to improve and create communication technology
    for first responders to work with this network. NIST''s PSCR Usability team has
    been contributing to this effort by conducting a multi-year, mixed methods study
    to examine first responders'' experiences with, problems with and needs of communication
    technology. The study consisted of two phases: in Phase 1, 193 first responders
    were interviewed, and in Phase 2, 7 182 first responders completed a survey of
    their communication technology experiences. Results of these efforts have been
    extensively reported on and are publicly available in eight reports. This report
    provides an in-depth statistical analysis of the survey data by exploring if and
    how communication technology problems and needs differ depending on the characteristics
    of the first responders. Specially, we examined differences by area (rural v.
    urban/suburban), role (frontline responders v. supervising responder, v. chief/management),
    and career v. volunteer status for fire service personnel. Two key themes emerged.
    First, we found that rural and volunteer first responders lack some devices and
    applications/software that their urban/suburban and career counterparts have,
    and they experience problems with the price of several devices. Second, we found
    that chief/management roles have different communication technology problems and
    needs from frontline first responders. Specifically, they tend to more often use
    devices and applications/software for coordination and managerial purposes and
    are very aware of the price of devices. This report provides a rich data and rigorous
    analysis for researchers, developers, and designers to use to inform their work
    in developing communication technology for first responders. We also describe
    how these findings relate to the user-centered guidelines published in previous
    reports.'
