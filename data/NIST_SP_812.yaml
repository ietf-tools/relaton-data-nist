abstract:
- content: The document contains standards of performance for laboratories that calibrate
    instrumentation used to measure ionizing radiation. Such standards are useful
    for the development of a secondary level of calibration laboratories that can
    provide a high-quality link between the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    and those who make routine measurements at the field level. The standards may
    also be used as criteria on which a decision is based regarding accreditation
    of a particular laboratory. They were developed by representatives of federally-owned
    laboratories that perform calibrations of the type addressed by the document.
    The first major part contains general criteria that must be satisfied by all laboratories
    seeking accreditation. It includes requirements relating to management and staff,
    physical aspects of the laboratory, calibrations facilities and equipment, operational
    procedures, accuracy and quality assurance, and records and reports. Five subsequent
    major parts establish criteria for calibration of survey instruments, irradiation
    of personnel dosimeters, calibration of sources, calibration of instruments for
    diagnostic levels, and calibration of reference-class instruments. The types of
    radiation covered include gamma rays, x rays, beta particles, neutrons, and alpha
    particles. An appendix describes the proficiency tests administered by NIST to
    secondary laboratories as a prerequisite for their accreditation.
