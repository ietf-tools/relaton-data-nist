abstract:
- content: This is the first reported use of Layer-by-Layer (LBL) assembly to fabricate
    thin film coatings on polyurethane foam, of incorporating carbon nanofibers (CNF)
    into LBL fabricated coatings, and of using LBL fabricated coatings to reduce the
    flammability of polyurethane foam. The (359 ± 36) nm thick four bilayer coating
    of polyethyleneimine/CNF (cationic layer) and poly(acrylic acid) (anionic layer)
    contained (50.9 ± 0.1) mass fraction % CNF. This CNF coating covered the entire
    internal and external surfaces of the porous foam. The distribution of the CNFs
    was non-uniform on the microscale with regions of large CNF aggregation to regions
    with individual CNFs and isolated regions that appeared to contain no CNFs. Even
    though the microscopic CNF distribution was non-uniform, the macroscopic CNF network
    armor that was generated from this LBL process significantly reduced the flammability
    of the foam; i.e., 55% ± 6% reduction in total heat release and peak heat release
    rate. This reduction caused by the CNF coating is 50% better than previously reported
    by incorporating twice as much CNFs directly into the foam and 12% to 47% greater
    than other technologies currently used to reduce foam flammability.
