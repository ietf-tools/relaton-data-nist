abstract:
- content: In September 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity
    (IARPA) held a data collection as part of its Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint Challenge.
    Participating Challengers deployed devices designed to collect an image of the
    full nail to nail surface area of a fingerprint - equivalent to a rolled fingerprint
    - from an unacclimated user, without assistance from a trained operator. Traditional
    operator-assisted live-scan rolled fingerprints were also captured, along with
    assorted other friction ridge live-scan and latent captures. The collection of
    images collected during the N2N Fingerprint Challenge, entitled Special Database
    302 (SD 302), can be freely downloaded from the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) website.
