abstract:
- content: As alternatives to refrigerants with a high global warming potential, blends
    of two or more refrigerants are being utilized as working fluids in heat-pumping,
    air-conditioning, and refrigeration systems, and organic Rankine cycles. Generally,
    these blends form zeotropes, which show temperature and composition changes during
    evaporation, condensation, or flashing process whether it be intended (i.e., through
    an expansion device) or unintended such as a leak from a container or system.
    For zeotropic blends, it may be important and necessary to predict the composition
    change for any of these leak conditions. REFLEAK simulates leak and recharge processes
    for refrigerant zeotropic blends. This Windows- based simulation model provides
    an easy-to-use package that allows estimation of composition changes of zeotropic
    blends in leak and recharge processes for either vapor or liquid leaks under isothermal
    or adiabatic conditions.
