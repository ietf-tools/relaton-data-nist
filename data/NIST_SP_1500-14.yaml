- content: The Department of Commerce (DOC) Boulder Laboratories (consisting of the
    National Institute for Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration);
    the DOC Office of Space Commerce; and the University of Colorado Boulder held
    a one-day Space Commerce Workshop on September 12, 2019. Members of industry,
    academia, and federal government organizations were brought together to identify
    key technology, measurement, and modeling barriers to deploying and safely operating
    commercial space technology. This workshop focused on technology barriers, solutions,
    and standards needed to foster conditions for economic growth and technical advancement
    of space industry. This document described key themes of the workshop and recommendations
    for overcoming the challenges of a continued increase in the number of government
    and commercial entities with industrially relevant objects in space.
