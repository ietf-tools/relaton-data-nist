abstract:
- content: For some 6,000 years, humans have made an indelible mark on history through
    the loops, strokes, and other characters that constitute the written form of language
    - handwriting. The study of handwriting is also an important part of forensic
    science. By analyzing the characteristics of a handwritten note or signature,
    a trained forensic document examiner may be able to extract valuable information
    for determining whether a note or signature is genuine, as well as the likely
    writer. As with all human endeavors, handwriting examination is not immune to
    errors. In June 2015, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology convened
    the Expert Working Group for Human Factors in Handwriting Examination to conduct
    a scientific assessment of the effects of human factors on forensic handwriting
    examination with the goal of recommending strategies and approaches to improve
    its practice and reduce the likelihood of errors. This report provides a comprehensive
    discussion of how human factors relate to all aspects of handwriting examinations
    including communicating conclusions to all relevant parties through reports and
    testimony. The report also discusses education, training, and certification as
    well as the role of quality assurance, quality control, and management in reducing
    errors.
