abstract:
- content: This publication describes an election results common data format specification
    for pre-election setup information and post-election results reporting. It contains
    a UML model of the election data and an XML format derived from the UML model.
    It also contains background information regarding how geopolitical geography is
    structured and used in the model and schema. The XML format is comprehensive and
    at the same time very flexible, able to accommodate election scenarios used throughout
    the U.S. It is part of a series of planned common data format specifications for
    voting equipment.
