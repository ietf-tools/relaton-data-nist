abstract:
- content: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for structural wind engineering
    applications require a fully developed boundary layer approach flow with horizontal
    homogeneity and zero pressure gradient for accurate characterization of wind loading
    on a structure. Previous studies have focused on achievement of such requirements
    primarily in computational domains whose heights are equal to or less than the
    atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) height, despite the need of a computational domain
    taller than the ABL height for certain applications such as buildings in an urban
    environment/or topographic surroundings to ensure an acceptably low blockage ratio.
    Thus, the current study proposes a novel procedure for the generation of the fully
    developed, horizontally homogeneous and zero pressure gradient flow in a vertically
    extended computational domain above the ABL height with using Reynolds-Averaged
    Navier-Stoke (RANS) simulations. The proposed procedure is applied to simulations
    with an isolated building and topographic models, respectively, to investigate
    the blockage effects on the flow field in the vicinity of the models and associated
    wind loading on their surfaces. The results demonstrate successful creation of
    the approach flow that satisfies those three requirements for CFD simulations
    in structural wind engineering and applicability to scale-resolving CFD simulations
    including large-eddy simulations (LES).
