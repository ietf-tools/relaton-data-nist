abstract:
- content: This document describes potential use-cases for data interoperability in
    election technology components not previously considered in past efforts. Such
    components include on-demand ballot printing systems, remote ballot marking systems
    and electronic poll books. Each component is described along with a set of generalized
    functions it performs. Existing common data formats are considered for their applicability
    to component functions. Where gaps are found, suggestions to enhance interoperability
    are described.
