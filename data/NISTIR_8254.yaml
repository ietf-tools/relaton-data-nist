abstract:
- content: Standard-sized ampoules for radioactive solution standards have been employed
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for nearly the past
    70 years. This report briefly summarizes the origins and history of the five different
    batches of ampoules that have been used, including details on the procurement
    and testing of the recent batch of replacement ampoules in 2018.
