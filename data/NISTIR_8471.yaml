abstract:
- content: 'This test data creation and population document provides an overview of
    data creation, population and documentation of artifacts created for cloud-based
    applications specified in Version 1 of Cloud & Remotely Stored Data Extraction
    (CDX) Using Account Credentials: Specification, Test Assertions, and Test Cases.
    Due to the frequency of application updates that may occur during testing, it
    is advised to document the version number of the current application under test
    to maintain the fairness and integrity of the tool verification process. Comments
    and feedback are welcome. This document, and future revisions, are available for
    download at: https:\\www.cftt.nist.gov.'
