abstract:
- content: This report identifies, summarizes, and evaluates the available data and
    the literature describing the economic costs associated with non-fatal firefighter
    injuries, illnesses, health exposures, and occupational disease ('health outcomes')
    resulting from line-of-duty activities. National firefighter non-fatal health
    outcome data, published by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), U.S.
    Fire Administration (USFA), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), are compared
    and contrasted in terms of coverage and detail provided. A survey of the economic
    injury literature is used to estimate the direct and indirect costs of non-fatal
    health outcomes. A matching procedure is introduced to combine the statistical
    and economic data to produce an annual estimate of firefighter non-fatal health
    outcome costs. The conclusion provides a discussion of the current measurement
    challenges that prevent a complete and throughout accounting of those costs associated
    with non-fatal firefighter injuries, illnesses, health exposures, and occupational
    disease. Data gaps exist, largely due to latency issues, in capturing the incidence
    and economic consequences associated with firefighter cancer and other occupational
    diseases, including post- traumatic stress injuries. The estimated cost of firefighter
    injury is estimated to range between $1.6 billion and $5.9 billion annually. This
    cost result in a loss equivalent of approximately $50,000 to $200,000 per fire
    department per year or $1,500 to $5,500 per firefighter per year.
