abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 150-17 presents technical requirements and guidance for the
    accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
    Program (NVLAP) Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Program. It is intended
    for information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation,
    laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing
    information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2008
    edition of NIST Handbook 150-l7 incorporates changes resulting from the release
    of the newest editions of ISO/IEC 17025, General requirements for the competence
    of testing and calibration laboratories, and NIST Handbook 150, NVLAP Procedures
    and General Requirements, as well as editorial improvements. The requirements
    of NIST Handbook 150, the interpretations and specific requirements in NIST Handbook
    150-17, and the requirements in the program-specific checklists must be combined
    to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP CST program. The 2008 edition
    of NIST Handbook 150-17 supersedes and replaces the 2000 edition of NIST Handbook
    150-17 Cryptographic Module Testing Program.
