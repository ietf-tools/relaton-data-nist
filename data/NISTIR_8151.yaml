abstract:
- content: 'The call for a dramatic reduction in software vulnerability is heard from
    multiple sources, recently from the February 2016 Federal Cybersecurity Research
    and Development Strategic Plan. This plan starts by describing well known risks:
    current systems perform increasingly vital tasks and are widely known to possess
    vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are often not easy to discover and difficult
    to correct. Cybersecurity has not kept pace, and the pace that is needed is rapidly
    accelerating. The goal of this report is to present a list of specific technical
    approaches that have the potential to make a dramatic difference in reducing vulnerabilities
    by stopping them before they occur, by finding them before they are exploited
    or by reducing their impact.'
