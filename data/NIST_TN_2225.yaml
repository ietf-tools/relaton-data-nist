abstract:
- content: The Engineering Laboratory (EL) of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) has developed a variety of tools that provide some level
    of economic analysis, many of which have been developed by EL s Applied Economics
    Office (AEO). AEO-developed tools range across topic areas and economic metrics.
    Each tool is targeting government agencies and organizations that fall under NIST
    s mission. Stakeholders need different levels of details and functionality because
    of the diverse backgrounds across stakeholders. As a result, AEO has developed
    these software tools in a one-off approach on an as needed basis. As a result,
    each software has its own unique set of code even though these tools have some
    key underlying components that are common across tools, including methodology
    documented in standards. To improve the efficiency of the tools developed by AEO
    and its stakeholders, AEO has developed an economic service/engine with an associated
    Application Programming Interface (API) that provides consistent, standardized,
    transparent, reproducible economic analysis calculations should be developed,
    maintained, and made publicly available for internal and external researchers,
    analysts, and software developers called the Economic Evaluation Engine (E3).
    E3 provides economic evaluation capabilities based on ASTM building economic standards
    including life-cycle cost analysis, benefit-cost analysis, profit maximization
    / cost-minimization, and risk-cost analysis. E3 could be leveraged by NIST as
    well as other federal agencies and national laboratories, state and local governments,
    academia, and the private sector to improve their tool development by using a
    federally developed and validated calculations to provide standard-consistent
    analysis. E3 is publicly accessible on a NIST server as well as on GitHub for
    anyone to use for economic analysis, whether it s through a basic script calling
    on the E3 API, online interface that connects to the E3 API, or an executable
    program that is built on E3 s capabilities. Additionally, users of E3 could provide
    expansions to the capabilities by developing the code and submitting it to NIST
    for review and incorporation. This technical manual describes E3, including the
    underlying standards on which its based, the data flow through the tool, details
    on the code libraries, classes, and file structure, development tools used, guidance
    on how to use the tool, limitations, planned release, and the development of its
    future capabilities.
