abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 44 is adopted by many state, local, and some federal weights
    and measures authorities to apply to commercial weighing and measuring equipment
    and associated equipment and for use in applications for law enforcement and the
    collection of statistical information by government agencies. This 2024 edition
    includes amendments made through the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances
    of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) with technical guidance
    from the Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) and input from weights and measures officials and industry
    representatives. These amendments were adopted by the NCWM at its 108th Annual
    Meeting in July 2023.
