abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 150-22 presents the technical requirements and guidance for
    the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
    Program (NVLAP) Voting Systems Testing program. It is intended for information
    and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation, laboratory
    accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing information
    on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2021 edition of
    NIST Handbook 150-22 incorporates changes resulting from the publication of VVSG
    2.0, as well as editorial improvements. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150
    and the specific requirements and interpretations in NIST Handbook 150-22 must
    be combined to produce the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP Voting Systems
    Testing program. For more information, visit the NVLAP website.
