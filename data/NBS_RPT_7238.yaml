abstract:
- content: This report deals with the prediction of service volumes (i. e., service
    ranges in three dimensions) for VOR and TACAN air navigation facilities in the
    presence of noise and interfering stations. Propagation mechanisms applicable
    to the frequency ranges employed are discussed first, together with calculation
    of transmission loss and its variability. Second, the statistical treatment of
    the interference problem is explained. Finally, it is shown how service volumes
    are determined based on transmission loss and its variations, specified or assumed
    criteria on signal-to-noise and signal-to-interference ratio, and the spatial
    relations of the aircraft, the desired facility, and the undesired facility. The
    results of the entire study are presented in graphical form. Detailed procedures,
    mathematical formulas, and computer programs used are discussed in the Appendix.
