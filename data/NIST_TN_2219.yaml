abstract:
- content: Homeowners are increasingly interested in installing solar photovoltaic
    (PV) systems on the roof of their homes. There is a lack of publicly available
    tools to assist homeowners in making such an investment decision. The Applied
    Economic Office (AEO) in the Engineering Laboratory (EL) of the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) is addressing this need by developing a free,
    public web interface that provides independent economic analysis for a specific
    home based on a user s solar installation quote and electricity bill.
