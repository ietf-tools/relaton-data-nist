abstract:
- content: 'A new approach to characterize airborne firebrands during Wildland Urban
    Interface (WUI) fires is detailed. The approach merges the following two imaging
    techniques in a single field-deployable diagnostic tool: 1/ 3D Particle Tracking
    Velocimetry (3D-PTV), allowing for the time-resolved mapping of firebrand 3D trajectories,
    and 2/ 3D Particle Shape Reconstruction (3D-PSR), used to reconstruct 3D models
    of individual particles following the Visual Hull principle. This tool offers
    for the first time the possibility to simultaneously study time-resolved firebrand
    fluxes and firebrand size distribution to the full extent of their three-dimensional
    nature. Methodologies used in the present work are presented and their technical
    implementation are thoroughly discussed. Validation tests to confirm proper tracking/sizing
    of particles are detailed. The diagnostic tool is applied to a firebrand shower
    artificially-generated at NIST National Fire Research Laboratory. A novel graphic
    representation, that incorporates both the Cumulative Particle Count (CPC, part.
    m-2) and Particle Number Flux (PNF, part. m-2 s-1) as relevant exposure metrics,
    is presented and the exposure level is compared to that of an actual outdoor fire.
    Size distributions obtained for airborne firebrands are compared to those achieved
    through ground collection and strategies to improve the particle shape reconstruction
    method are discussed.'
