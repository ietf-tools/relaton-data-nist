abstract:
- content: In this paper we analyze elements of the Unified Modeling Language (UML),
    specifically the class diagram, and propose an simplified alternative language
    based on a branch of mathematics called category theory (CT). We argue that modeling
    in CT provides a richer and more precise formal structure than UML, while still
    supporting many of the intuitive and diagrammatic features which engineers appreciate
    in UML. Deep ties connect CT to formal logic, physics and computer science, helping
    to connect our CT-based models to simulation and implementation. We proceed by
    walking through the constructs of the class diagram and showing how the same information
    can be captured using CT constructions. As we do, we see that some UML constructs
    are redundant while others smuggle in assumptions which ought to be made explicit.
    Thus we argue that the use of CT in information modeling can make our models less
    ambiguous, more precise and more formal.
