abstract:
- content: 'Standard installation practices were developed to assistin assuring the
    effectiveness and safety of energy conservation measures installed under the Residential
    Conservation Service (RCS). They serve as mandatory standards under RCS but are
    recommended guides for all installations of the covered materials and products.
    The criteria are being used by DoE to develop training manuals for installers,
    inspectors, and energy auditors. Part I provides information on the intended use
    of the practices, outlines the RCS program, and discusses specific major technical
    and related issues that were considered in the development of the standards: moisture
    and building retrofit, attic ventilation, electrical wiring, recessed and surface-mounted
    fixtures, the use of diagnostic tools (infrared thermography, air change rate,
    and window air leakage measurements), and product certification. Part II provides
    the actual practices together with commentary and additional recommendations.'
