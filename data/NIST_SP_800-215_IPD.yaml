abstract:
- content: Access to multiple cloud services, the geographic spread of enterprise
    IT resources (including multiple data centers), and the emergence of microservices-based
    applications (as opposed to monolithic ones) have significantly altered the enterprise
    network landscape. This document is meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise
    network landscape from a secure operations perspective. Hence, it starts by examining
    the security limitations of the current network access solutions to the enterprise
    network. It then considers security feature enhancements to traditional network
    appliances in the form of point security solutions, network configurations for
    various security functions (e.g., application security, cloud access security,
    device or endpoint security, etc.), security frameworks that integrate these individual
    network configurations, and the evolving wide area network (WAN) infrastructure
    to provide a comprehensive set of security services for the modern enterprise
    network landscape.
