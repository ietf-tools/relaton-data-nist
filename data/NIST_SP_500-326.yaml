abstract:
- content: Software assurance has been the focus of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE)
    team for many years. The Static Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE) is one of the
    team s prominent projects to advance research in and adoption of static analysis,
    one of several software assurance methods. This report describes our approach
    and methodology. It then presents and discusses the results collected from the
    fifth edition of SATE. Overall, the goal of SATE was not to rank static analysis
    tools, but rather to propose a methodology to assess tool effectiveness. Others
    can use this methodology to determine which tools fit their requirements. The
    results in this report are presented as examples and used as a basis for further
    discussion. Our methodology relies on metrics, such as recall and precision, to
    determine tool effectiveness. To calculate these metrics, we designed test cases
    that exhibit certain characteristics. Most of the test cases were large pieces
    of software with cybersecurity implications. Fourteen participants ran their tools
    on these test cases and sent us a report of their findings. We analyzed these
    reports and calculated the metrics to assess the tools effectiveness. Although
    a few results remained inconclusive, many key elements could be inferred based
    on our methodology, test cases, and analysis. In particular, we were able to estimate
    the propensity of tools to find critical vulnerabilities in real software, the
    degree of noise they produced, and the type of weaknesses they were able to find.
    Some shortcomings in the methodology and test cases were also identified and solutions
    proposed for the next edition of SATE.
