abstract:
- content: Similarity and dissimilarity metrics are a fundamental component of many
    tasks requiring the analysis and comparison of complex, often visual data. Applications
    from deep learning to forensics require ways to effectively identify images, find
    clusters or outliers in data sets, or retrieve data items similar to a query item.
    However, finding an effective metric for a specific task is challenging due to
    the complexity of modern datasets and the myriad possible similarity metrics arising
    from that complexity. We present VEMOS, a Python package that provides an accessible
    graphical user interface (GUI) for the evaluation of comparison metrics. VEMOS
    provides user-friendly ways to examine individual data items or groups in a data
    set alongside analyses of metrics' performance on the whole data set, such as
    clustering, multi-dimensional scaling, and retrieval performance analyses. VEMOS
    aims to help researchers and practitioners evaluate multiple comparison metrics
    on rich, diverse data sets.
