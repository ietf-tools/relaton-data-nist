abstract:
- content: This Guide Brief aims to assist the collaborative planning team with Step
    4, Plan Development, by supporting communities in identifying resilience gaps
    using the performance goals tables. These performance goals focus on system function
    rather than individual component performance. The document discusses approaches
    to prioritize actions that address those gaps and/or mitigation measures to close
    those gaps. Both are essential aspects of developing an overall resilience plan.
