abstract:
- content: The report summarizes NBS research in the area of walkway and shoe slip-resistance
    measurement since 1924 and outlines current activities that will provide a technical
    basis for slip-resistance measurement. Current activities in data base development
    and identification of standard reference surfaces contribute to a rational basis
    for quantitative slip-resistance criteria for building codes and standards. Proposed
    future research thrusts include personal factors such as human biokinetic and
    perceptual variables, as well as environmental factors such as lighting in the
    built environment. The research will contribute to the development of new intervention
    strategies to reduce deaths and injuries due to slips and falls.
