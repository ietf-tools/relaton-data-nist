abstract:
- content: Resistance strain gages of the HT-1200 series, manufactured by High Temperature
    Instruments Corporation, were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The characteristics
    determined were (1) gage factor at room temperature, (2) variation of gage factor
    with increasing temperature, (3) drift, (4) resistance- temperature relationship,
    (5) behavior under transient heating conditions, and (6) behavior when subjected
    to large strains. The results of these tests indicate that these gages, when attached
    to stainless steel, have a high but somewhat erratic gage factor, low drift at
    temperatures up to 700¿̐¿ F, and a high but stable temperature coefficient of
    resistance. (summary)
