abstract:
- content: X-ray powder diffraction analysis is used in the cement industry as a direct
    analytical method for phase identification and quantitative analysis of clinker
    and cements. Quantitative methods initially relied on the development of calibration
    curves, employing multiple reference mixtures of cement phases with an internal
    standard to develop a plot of diffraction peak intensity ratios vs. mass fraction
    ratios. Obstacles to this approach were the availability of reference standards
    that adequately replicated those phases in the clinker or cement, and the ability
    to accurately measure diffraction peak intensities because of severe peak overlap.
    The Rietveld method for analysis of powder diffraction data addresses both of
    these difficulties through use of refineable crystal structure models to calculate
    the individual phase diffraction patterns and a whole-pattern fitting procedure
    to minimize the difference between the measured diffraction pattern and set of
    calculated phase patterns. This approach has revolutionized the application of
    X-ray powder diffraction in many scientific disciplines, including that of hydraulic
    cements, but can be a complicated method to learn. This tutorial is intended to
    provide an introduction to the application of Rietveld analysis to portland cement
    clinker and cements using examples developed from one of the NIST SRM clinkers
    and two portland cements.
