abstract:
- content: This publication describes an election event logging common data format
    specification for devices used in U.S. elections such as optical scanners, election
    management systems, and polling place devices. The data logged generally contains
    information about the conduct of the election, such as when the polls open, when
    a voter starts a voting session or casts a ballot, or when administrators logon
    to the devices, etc. The publication contains a UML model of the relevant election
    logging data and background information regarding requirements for election event
    logging in the Election Assistance Commission's Voluntary Voting System Guidelines.
