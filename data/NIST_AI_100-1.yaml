abstract:
- content: As directed by the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020
    (P.L. 116-283), the goal of the AI RMF is to offer a resource to the organizations
    designing, developing, deploying, or using AI systems to help manage the many
    risks of AI and promote trustworthy and responsible development and use of AI
    systems. The Framework is intended to be voluntary, rights-preserving, non-sector
    specific, and use-case agnostic, providing flexibility to organizations of all
    sizes and in all sectors and throughout society to implement the approaches in
    the Framework. The AI RMF is intended to be practical, to adapt to the AI landscape
    as AI technologies continue to develop, and to be operationalized by organizations
    in varying degrees and capacities so society can benefit from AI while also being
    protected from its potential harms.
