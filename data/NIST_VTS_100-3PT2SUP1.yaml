abstract:
- content: 'This document is the third part of a series of documents on the usability
    of electronic pollbooks. It is supplementary to Part Two in the series, Usability
    Testing for E-pollbooks: A Test Protocol. In the effort to create this series,
    dozens of items were identified that can be used to evaluate e-pollbooks for usability
    and accessibility. These items form the usability checklists in this document
    and are organized by poll workersâ€™ tasks. They are not absolute requirements,
    but a guide to evaluating how well a specific e-pollbook supports poll workers
    and voters in the polling place. Research referenced in this report was conducted
    in 2017. The use of e-pollbooks presented throughout the document reflects the
    state of elections in 2017. In the time since this research was performed, e-pollbooks
    have made progress addressing usability and accessibility issues. Additionally,
    as part of its ongoing Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP)
    program, the Election Assistance Commission developed the Voluntary Electronic
    Poll Book Requirements (VEPBR) in collaboration with NIST. This publication is
    intended to provide a deep dive into how to evaluate the usability and accessibility
    of e-pollbooks in order to meet the relevant VEPBR user-centered design process
    and usability testing requirements as well as any state certifications pertaining
    to usability and accessibility.'
