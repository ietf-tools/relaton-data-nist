abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established a
    Vitamin D Metabolites Quality Assurance Program (VitDQAP) in collaboration with
    the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS) in 2009.
    The VitDQAP at NIST administered twelve interlaboratory comparison exercises through
    2016 for the measurement of vitamin D metabolites in human serum and plasma. The
    comparability of participant measurements for target analytes improved substantially
    over time through the development and promulgation of robust measurement technologies,
    identification and production of suitable reference materials, isolation and identification
    of measurement system biases, and support and encouragement of within-laboratory
    measurement quality control efforts. This VitDQAP Final Report summarizes the
    program and provides highlights of the twelve exercises conducted during the program's
    eight-year lifetime.
