abstract:
- content: 'The need to provide protection for federal information systems has been
    present since computers were first used. Including security early in the acquisition
    process for an information system will usually result in less expensive and more
    effective security than adding it to an operational system once it has entered
    service. This guide presents a framework for incorporating security into all phases
    of the information system development life cycle (SDLC) process, from initiation
    to disposal. This document is a guide to help organizations select and acquire
    cost-effective security controls by explaining how to include information system
    security requirements in the SDLC.Five phases of a general SDLC are discussed
    in this guide and include the following phases: initiation, acquisition/development,
    implementation, operations/maintenance, and disposition. Each of these five phases
    includes a minimum set of security steps needed to effectively incorporate security
    into a system during its development. An organization will either use the general
    SDLC described in this document or will have developed a tailored SDLC that meets
    their specific needs. In either case, NIST recommends that organizations incorporate
    the associated IT security steps of this general SDLC into their own development
    process.'
