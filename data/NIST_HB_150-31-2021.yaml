abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 150-31 presents the technical requirements and guidance for
    the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
    Program (NVLAP) Healthcare Information Technology program. It is intended for
    information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation,
    laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing
    information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2021
    edition of NIST Handbook 150-31 incorporates changes resulting from the clause
    numbering updates to reflect that used by ISO/IEC 17025:2017, all references to
    applicable international guides and standards have been updated, as well as editorial
    improvements. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150 and the specific requirements
    and interpretations in NIST Handbook 150-31 must be combined to produce the criteria
    for accreditation in the NVLAP Healthcare Information Technology program. For
    more information, visit the NVLAP website.
