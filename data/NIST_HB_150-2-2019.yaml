abstract:
- content: 'NIST Handbook 150-2, NVLAP Calibration Laboratories, presents the technical
    requirements and guidance for the accreditation of laboratories under the NVLAP
    Calibration Laboratories LAP. The 2019 edition of NIST Handbook 150-2 supersedes
    and replaces the 2016 edition. The handbook was revised with the participation
    of technical experts in the eight fields of calibration: dimensional, electromagnetics
    dc/low frequency, electromagnetics rf/microwave frequency, time and frequency,
    ionizing radiation, mechanical, optical radiation, and thermodynamic.'
