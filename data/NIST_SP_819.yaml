abstract:
- content: High quality liquid-in-glass thermometers require only one complete calibration
    in their lifetime and it is possible to avoid the usual requirement for complete
    recalibration of the instrument by the recalibration of a single previously calibrated
    temperature. The need for recalibration of properly manufactured liquid-in-glass
    thermometers is due to the gradual relaxation of residual mechanical strains in
    the glass that have a significant effect on the volume of the bulb. The recalibration
    of a single point provides a reliable indication of the effect of this change
    in volume and provides a means for the accurate adjustment of the remainder of
    the scale. The paper describes a procedure for the single temperature recalibration
    of liquid-in-glass thermometers that can be performed in the user's laboratory
    and the subsequent adjustment of the entire scale. The adjustment of the scale
    that is required by the recent introduction of the new International Temperature
    Scale (ITS-90) is also described.
