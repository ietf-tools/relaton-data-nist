abstract:
- content: Type FNW-FB-9-50-12 resistance strain gages, manufactured by the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton
    Corporation, were evaluated. The results of these tests indicate that the gage
    factor for compressive loading is somewhat higher than for tensile loading; that
    the gage factor decreases with increasing temperature by about one-half percent
    per 100¿̐¿ F; that large errors can be expected when strains greater than 0.002
    are measured; that the gages are well compensated for resistance instability;
    that the temperature sensitivity is low and repeatable from gage to gage, but
    the gage response is strongly affected by heating rate; and that the leakage resistance
    is influenced by temperature and the thermal history of the gage.
