abstract:
- content: This bibliography cites selected books and articles on computer security
    published from January 1980 through October 1989. To have been selected, an article
    had to be substantial in content and have been published in professional or technical
    journals, magazines, or conference proceedings. Only very substantial articles
    from the popular or trade press were included. English language articles from
    foreign journals were included as available. The citations are listed under nine
    categories. A tenth category of pre-1980 publications is also provided, as well
    as an appendix containing addresses of all journals and magazines referenced in
    the bibliography.
