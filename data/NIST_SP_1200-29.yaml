abstract:
- content: In this special publication, we report on a modified synthetic process
    that results in a stable suspension of Au-PEI nanoparticles, Au-PEI@NIST. Synthesized
    materials were characterized using an orthogonal approach that included dynamic
    light scattering (DLS), UV-Vis absorbance (UV-Vis), transmission electron microscopy
    (TEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Very
    importantly, the end-product in this study demonstrated excellent colloidal stability
    in multiple aqueous environments including over a wide pH and temperature range
    of physiological relevance. The product also exhibited long-term storage stability
    under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of Au-PEI@NIST was investigated
    using the CHO K1 cell line and exhibited dose proportional toxicity, which suggested
    potential for use as a positive control in nanotoxicology studies. The results
    and stringent testing regimen point toward an effective and sustainable approach
    that can serve as a clarified starting point for the development of more complex
    conjugates for nanomedicine area.
