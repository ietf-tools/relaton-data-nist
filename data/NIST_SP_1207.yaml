abstract:
- content: Homeowners and builders have increasingly strived to build low energy homes.
    As building materials, equipment, and methods have improved and renewable energy
    systems have become commonplace, the goal of net-zero energy homes has become
    technologically viable. Such an example of these capabilities is on display in
    the NetZero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF), located at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. While
    the NIST NZERTF has shown that net-zero energy performing homes are technologically
    feasible using conventional technologies, questions related to costs continue
    to arise. Economic performance evaluation is reliant on accurate construction
    cost data, which may change significantly over time as industry learns how to
    implement energy-efficiency measures into building design and more energy-efficient
    technology diffuses into the marketplace. In order to update the underlying data
    in NISTs economic analysis, a NIST-funded contract was completed to estimate the
    costs of building components designed to meet current Maryland building energy
    code based on 2015 IECC as well as higher efficiency building components that
    are either currently installed in the NZERTF or will be installed in the NZERTF
    in the near future. The purpose of this study is to summarize the cost estimates
    generated by the outside contractor. These estimates will then be compared to
    those from multiple existing data sources. Findings from this study will help
    provide a reasonable range of cost estimates for different building components
    that can be used for future research related to the low- and net-zero energy building
    designs in particular, research related to the NZERTF and the Building Industry
    Reporting and Design for Sustainability (BIRDS) software tool.
