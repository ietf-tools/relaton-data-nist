abstract:
- content: 'Community resilience is a topic of increasing interest in public policy
    and planning, although effective implementation will require an in-depth theoretical
    understanding of the concept, as well as the ability to measure changes in resilience
    over time. In recent years numerous frameworks have been developed to operationalize
    community resilience, utilizing different theoretical and methodological approaches.
    As part of an effort to systematically document and compare existing frameworks
    in the Resilience Indicator Inventory, research led by the Community Resilience
    Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected
    56 community resilience frameworks and assessment tools for further analysis.
    This annotated bibliography is intended to achieve two main objectives: 1) provide
    context to the primary sources used in the Resilience Indicator Inventory dataset,
    and 2) summarize previous work in community resilience measurement as a resource
    for future planning and research. Work in this area will inform NIST s ongoing
    efforts in resilience metrology, including facilitating the development of a theoretically
    and empirically based method of resilience measurement.'
