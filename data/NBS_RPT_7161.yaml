abstract:
- content: Type FNH-25-12B resistance strain gages, manufactured by the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton
    Corporation, were evaluated at elevated temperatures. The factors investigated
    included (1) gage factor at about 75¿̐¿ F, (2) variation of gage factor with increasing
    temperature, (3) response when subjected to large strains, (4) change of resistance
    with time at various constant temperatures, (5) change of resistance with temperature,
    (6) response when subjected to high heating rates, and (7) resistance between
    the gage and the base material. The results of these tests indicate that the gage
    factor at 75¿̐¿ F is within the manufacturer's stated range; that the gage factor
    at 1000¿̐¿ F is about 90 percent of the room temperature value; that the gages
    are able to sustain strains of 0.004 at 75¿̐¿ F and of 0o002 at 600¿̐¿ F; that
    the temperature coefficient of resistance of the gages installed on type 302 stainless
    steel is high, positive, and nearly constant between 75¿̐¿ and 800¿̐¿ F but changes
    rapidly and becomes very high between 800¿̐¿ and 1200¿̐¿ F; and that the gage
    response is repeatable under a given transient heating condition.
