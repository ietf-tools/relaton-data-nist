abstract:
- content: This Second Edition of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-21, updates and
    replaces the November 1999 edition of Guideline for Implementing Cryptography
    in the Federal Government. Many of the references and cryptographic techniques
    contained in the first edition of NIST SP 800-21 have been amended, rescinded,
    or superseded since its publication. The current publication offers new tools
    and techniques. NIST SP 800-21 is intended to provide a structured, yet flexible
    set of guidelines for selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating cryptographic
    protection mechanisms in Federal information systems?and thus, makes a significant
    contribution toward satisfying the security requirements of the Federal Information
    Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347. The current publication
    also reflects the elimination of the waiver process by the Federal Information
    Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. SP 800-21 includes background information,
    describes the advantages of using cryptography; defines the role and use of standards
    and describes standards organizations that are outside the Federal government;
    describes the methods that are available for symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography;
    describes implementation issues (e.g., key management); discusses assessments,
    including the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), the Common Criteria
    (CC), and Certification and Accreditation (C&A); and describes the process of
    choosing the types of cryptography to be used and selecting a cryptographic method
    or methods to fulfill a specific requirement.
