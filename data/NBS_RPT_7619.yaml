abstract:
- content: Radio system parameters are combined with geophysical and ionospheric characteristics
    to predict the performance of high frequency sky-wave communication circuits through
    the use of electronic computers. A program is presented to compute Maximum Usable
    Frequencies, Optimum Traffic Frequencies, Lowest Useful Frequencies, probable
    mode of propagation, angle of arrival, circuit reliability, system loss, available
    signal-to-noise and field strength. Numerical representation is used for all parameters
    not expressed in closed mathematical form.
