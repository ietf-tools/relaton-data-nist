abstract:
- content: This report summarizes the results from the OAGi/NIST workshop Drilling
    down on Smart Manufacturing -- Enabling Composable Apps, which was held at the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology campus in Gaithersburg, MD, on
    April 18-19, 2016. The purpose of the workshop was to identify and discuss challenges
    in advancing the vision of composable manufacturing systems within the context
    of open cloud service platforms for Smart Manufacturing systems. The report describes
    (1) the idea of composable Service-Oriented Manufacturing systems as a basis for
    achieving easily assembled and re-configured Smart Manufacturing systems, (2)
    the results of five breakout sessions, and (3) the key findings from the workshop
    as well as the next steps planned for the workshop series. The breakout session
    descriptions provide an overview of respective R&D areas, their goals, capability
    gaps, proposed technology characteristics, and priority working items.
