abstract:
- content: The document highlights examples for implementing the Framework for Improving
    Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (known as the Cybersecurity Framework) in
    a manner that complements the use of other NIST security and privacy risk management
    standards, guidelines, and practices. These examples include support for an Enterprise
    Risk Management (ERM) approach in alignment with OMB and FISMA requirements that
    agency heads manage risk commensurate with the magnitude of harm that would result
    from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction
    of a federal information system or federal information. The use of the Cybersecurity
    Framework s components enable discussion about the various types of risk that
    might occur within federal organizations and promote conversations about how to
    determine the likelihood and potential consequences of risk events. These activities
    can then be combined with those described in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-37,
    Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations;
    SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk; and other guidelines to form a
    comprehensive risk-based approach for security and privacy. This risk-based approach
    will assist agencies in determining the risks that are relevant to its mission
    throughout the operational lifecycle and apply an appropriate type and degree
    of resources to treat those risks to an acceptable level. Examples in this publication
    will demonstrate the use of the Cybersecurity Framework, the NIST Risk Management
    Framework (RMF), and other models to evaluate and report agency goals and progress
    and to inform tailoring activities for managing cybersecurity risk appropriately.
    Use of a comprehensive cybersecurity risk-based approach, as demonstrated through
    these examples, supports agencies activities to meet their concurrent obligations
    to comply with the requirements of FISMA and Executive Order (EO) 13800.
