abstract:
- content: This report documents heat release rate measurements of various transient
    combustibles; that is, non-permanent items found in industrial settings that can
    potentially contribute to an accidental fire. These items are often included in
    hypothetical fire scenarios that are modeled as part of risk analyses. Of particular
    interest in these experiments is the functional relationship between the peak
    heat release rate and the number of replicate items.
