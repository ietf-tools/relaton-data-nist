abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) workshop on Software
    Measures and Metrics to Reduce Security Vulnerabilities (SwMM-RSV) was held on
    July 12, 2016. The goal of this workshop is to gather ideas on how the Federal
    Government can identify, improve, package, deliver, or boost the use of software
    measures and metrics to significantly reduce vulnerabilities. This report contains
    observations and recommendations based upon the workshop. This report also includes
    position statements submitted to the workshop, presentations at the workshop,
    and related material. Ideas from the workshop will be included in the report on
    Dramatically Reducing Software Vulnerabilities report, requested of NIST by the
    White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in Spring 2016.
