abstract:
- content: Wide deployment of wireless communications plays an essential role in the
    vision of future cyber-physical systems (CPSs), which includes massive transfer
    of automation information. Many practical considerations of industrial CPSs affect
    the success of the deployment of industrial wireless networks, and, thus, can
    inhibit their widespread adoption. These considerations include multi-path propagation,
    network congestion, and jamming interference. Jamming is of chief concern when
    wireless is used for mission critical or safety integrated systems. In this paper,
    an experimental platform consisting of a robot arm depressing a spring mechanism
    with a wireless force-feedback control algorithm is constructed. The robot applies
    downward pressure on a spring assembly until a predetermined force is detected
    and transmitted successfully to the controller under varying levels of sustained
    interference. Machine learning is used to learn and predict the signal-to-interference
    level of the communication link solely using position information from an independent
    vision tracking system. Various supervised learning algorithms are investigated
    and rated according to their performance.
