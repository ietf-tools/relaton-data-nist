abstract:
- content: This study reports on the change in flammability of cotton fabrics caused
    by water-insoluble gel coatings applied from a single bath solution formulated
    with polymeric micelles and flame retardant amphiphiles. The flame resistant coatings
    are made from low concentration aqueous formulations of polyethylene oxide-polypropylene
    oxide-polyethylene oxide, and 5 % to 15 % mass fraction melamine and sodium hexametaphosphate.
    The coated cotton fabrics were tested and characterized by a variety of bench-scale
    tools, such as vertical flame testing, micro-scale combustion calorimetry, and
    thermogravimetric analysis. Properties such as increased ignition resistance,
    self-extinguishment, and higher decomposition temperatures were measured, relative
    to the uncoated cotton.
