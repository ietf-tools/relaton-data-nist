abstract:
- content: Firebrand showers have been identified as a primary mechanism of fire spread
    and cause of destruction in wildland-urban interface fires. The heat transfer
    processes that follow deposition of firebrands and lead to ignition have received
    little attention until recently. While conventional methods of measuring temperature
    and heat flux provide bulk-averaged information regarding deposited firebrand
    piles, they fall short of elucidating essential information such as surface contact
    areas and heat feed-back mechanisms, that are necessary for understanding ignition
    propensity and developing high-fidelity physics-based models. This work describes
    the development and implementation of a spatially resolved optical technique for
    quantifying heat flux and thermal footprint of firebrand piles using laser induced
    phosphorescence of YAG:Dy. The technique involves coating the surface of a UVtransparent
    substrate with YAG:Dy phosphors to yield surface temperature. Heat flux is inferred
    through simultaneously measuring the top and bottom substrate surface temperatures
    after they are coated with a staggered grating pattern. An intensity ratio over
    two separate spectral regions of emission is used to calibrate the optical measurement
    system and infer temperature from 300 K - 1100 K over a 7 cm diameter interrogation
    area. The uncertainty in temperature and heat flux are discussed in detail. The
    spatial resolution of the temperature and heat flux measurements are 0.5 mm and
    4 mm, respectively.
