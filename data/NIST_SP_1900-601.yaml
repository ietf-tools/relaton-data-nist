abstract:
- content: 'This report reviews a set of electric grid ancillary services and analyzes
    the technical potential for residential devices to provide those services. A set
    of common residential devices are evaluated against six indicators of capability:
    flexibility, availability, fast response, reserves, reactive power, and power
    level. Based on these indicators of capability, three scores are developed to
    express the potential of a device to provide frequency response, reserves and
    reactive power services. These scores are additionally used to estimate how many
    of each device might be required, in aggregation, to provide a meaningful level
    of each of these three ancillary services to the grid. This report also provides
    a review of some existing programs and pilot efforts where residential devices
    are being used to provide ancillary services. Lastly, the report provides insights
    on a continued path to increased integration of residential devices for ancillary
    services provision.'
