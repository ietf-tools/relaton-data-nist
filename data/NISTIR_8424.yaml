abstract:
- content: NIST provides certified reference Charpy specimens to companies and laboratories
    around the world for the indirect verification of impact machines in accordance
    with ASTM E23. Specimens are available at three energy levels, low (?15 J at 40
    ?C), high (?100 J at -40 ?C), and super-high (?200 J at room temperature). Specimens
    of this latter energy level have been out of stock from the late 2000s until the
    late 2010s, when specimens of AISI 9310 steel were found to be suitable for standardization,
    provided they were side-grooved in order to prevent the formation of shear lips.
    This study was aimed at establishing an optimal combination of heat treatment
    (specifically, final tempering temperature) and side-groove depth for Charpy specimens
    of 9310 steel, and was conducted by testing almost 900 specimens corresponding
    to six different combinations. As a result of this study, a recommendation for
    the heat treatment and side-groove depth of future super-high energy specimen
    lots was formulated.
