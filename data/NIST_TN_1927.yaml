abstract:
- content: Experiments were conducted to investigate the capabilities and limitations
    of compressed air foam (CAF) relative to water when used for interior structural
    fire fighting. The key outcomes were to measure the gas cooling and fire suppression
    capabilities of CAF compared to water. The experimental designs were developed
    based on a project planning workshop led by the Fire Protection Research Foundation.
    Incidents where firefighters had experienced burn injuries or other challenges
    while using CAF during interior attack operations in residential occupancies served
    as the catalyst for this study. Full scale fire experiments designed to address
    those questions were conducted over a period of years from 2012 through 2015.
    The experimental arrangements and results are presented in this report. The results
    from both the gas cooling and the suppression of residential scale room fires
    showed the effectiveness of water and CAF hose streams to be similar. Under the
    test conditions, both agents were effective. This study did not address the previously
    documented attributes of CAF for improved exposure protection and improved prevention
    of a fire re-kindle relative to plain water. This study, conducted by NIST, was
    part of a larger research project led by California Polytechnic State University
    (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo in collaboration with the Montgomery County (MD) Fire
    and Rescue Service. This study was supported in part by a DHS/FEMA Assistance
    to Firefighters Research and Development Grant.
