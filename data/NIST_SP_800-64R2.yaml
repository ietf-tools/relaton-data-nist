abstract:
- content: The purpose of this guideline is to assist agencies in building security
    into their IT development processes. This should result in more cost-effective,
    risk-appropriate security control identification, development, and testing. This
    guide focuses on the information security components of the System Development
    Life Cycle (SDLC). Overall system implementation and development is considered
    outside the scope of this document. Also considered outside scope is an organization⁰₉s
    information system governance process. The guideline describes the key security
    roles and responsibilities that are needed in development of most information
    systems. Sufficient information about the SDLC is provided to allow a person who
    is unfamiliar with the SDLC process to understand the relationship between information
    security and the SDLC.
