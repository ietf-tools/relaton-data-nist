abstract:
- content: This Guide Brief reviews the performance goals tables used in Step 3 of
    the Guide. These tables offer an approach to evaluate the anticipated recovery
    of building clusters and infrastructure systems and the services they support.
    The summary performance goals table gives community resilience planners a one-page
    view of what the community needs from its buildings and infrastructure systems
    when a routine, design, or extreme hazard event occurs.
