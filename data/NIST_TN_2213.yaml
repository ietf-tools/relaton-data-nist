abstract:
- content: Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have been used for decades to
    evaluate indoor air quality (IAQ) and ventilation, and more recently in discussions
    of the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission. However, many applications
    of indoor CO2 measurement reflect a lack of understanding of the connection between
    indoor CO2 levels, ventilation and IAQ. In many cases, an indoor concentration
    of 1000 ppmv has been used as a metric of IAQ and ventilation without an understanding
    of its basis or significance. After many years trying to dissuade practitioners
    and researchers from using this or some other single concentration as an overall
    metric of ventilation and IAQ, an approach has been developed to determine a space-specific
    CO2 level that can be used as an indicator of the outdoor ventilation rate. The
    concept is to estimate the CO2 concentration that would be expected in a specific
    space given its intended or expected ventilation rate per person, the number of
    occupants and the rate at which they generate CO2. A calculation method is described
    for estimating the CO2 concentration in a given space at selected times after
    occupancy starts, which provides a more meaningful metric than a single value
    for all spaces. An online tool (QICO2, Quick Indoor CO2) has been developed to
    perform these calculations, and this report also contains a User Guide for that
    tool.
