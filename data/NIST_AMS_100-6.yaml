abstract:
- content: A series of 11 identical laser based powder bed fusion (PBF) builds were
    completed with varying amounts of virgin and recycled nitrogen gas atomized S17-4
    PH stainless steel powder following a specific powder recycling strategy that
    simulates industrial practice. Mechanical properties of parts were evaluated using
    tensile and hardness tests. Recycled powder properties, such as particle size
    distribution, flowability, chemical composition, and microstructure were evaluated.
    The recycled powder showed no significant changes in its particle size and particle
    shape but apparent density and powder bed density increased while flow time improved.
    Recycling the powder in a nitrogen atmosphere caused a slight increase of the
    martensite phase in the predominately austenitic S17-4 PH powder. PBF fabricated
    austenitic-/ martensitic S17-4 PH showed a ratio of approximately 50 % to 50 %
    between austenite and martensite. Tensile tests on the stress relieve heat treated
    specimens did not show any dramatic change in the tensile properties with recycling
    up to 11 times. The fine dendritic, austenitic / martensitic microstructure of
    the stress relieved heat treated S17-4 PH reached a tensile strength of YS0.2
    above 520 MPa, and an elongation of 28 %. Mechanical and material properties from
    specimens fabricated from powder recycled up to 11 times were similar to specimens
    fabricated from virgin powder.
