abstract:
- content: A new constant force experiment has been used to study the minimum force
    required to maintain a seal with five of the better elastomeric O-ring compounds.
    The most significant result is development of an indium-elastomer sandwich arrangement
    which takes advantage of the favorable properties of both materials and greatly
    reduces the force required to maintain a seal at cryogenic temperature. Force
    decay data are given for three more groups of elastomeric O-rings and some general
    ideas on seal design are presented.
