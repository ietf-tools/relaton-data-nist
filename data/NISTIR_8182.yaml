abstract:
- content: The LIGA process (Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung, or lithography,
    electrodeposition, shaping) offers the possibility of mass producing strong mesoscale
    (order of a few mm or less) metal components of nearly any planar shape. Multilayer
    deposition has been developed to create three-dimensional shapes. The overall
    objective of this multi-year project is to enable the use of the Johnson-Cook
    flow and fracture models for evaluation of structural elements made from two LIGA
    alloys of interest, by providing the material property data at the microscale
    needed to carry out structural analyses utilizing these models. This report documents
    the first milestone in the project, which is the measurement of the room-temperature
    tensile properties of two LIGA alloys of one commercial vendor's proprietary materials
    - one optimized for strength and the other for ductility, with nominal thicknesses
    190 -m and 170 -m respectively - at strain rates 0.001/s and 1/s, utilizing four
    specimen geometries with gauge widths ranging from 75-m to 700-m. Test methods
    adapted to the scale of these materials were applied. Results, measurement uncertainties,
    and statistical variations for the ultimate tensile strength and apparent Young's
    modulus are quantified for all combinations of these material/geometry/rate variations.
    In addition, preliminary studies were conducted into the effects of low-temperature
    annealing on the materials' strength, and use of electron back scatter diffraction
    to observe the microstructure.
