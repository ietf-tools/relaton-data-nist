abstract:
- content: 'This guide provides general implementation guidance (Volume 1) and example
    proof-of-concept solutions demonstrating how available open-source and commercial
    off-the-shelf (COTS) products could be implemented in manufacturing environments
    to satisfy the requirements in the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Manufacturing
    Profile Low Impact Level. Example proof-ofconcept solutions with measured network,
    device, and operational performance impacts for a process-based manufacturing
    environment (Volume 2) and a discrete-based manufacturing environment (Volume
    3) are included in the guide. Manufacturers should make their own determinations
    about the breadth of the proof-of-concept solutions they voluntarily implement.
    Some important factors to consider include: company size, cybersecurity expertise,
    risk tolerance, and the threat landscape. The CSF Manufacturing Profile can be
    used as a roadmap for managing cybersecurity risk for manufacturers and is aligned
    with manufacturing sector goals and industry best practices. The Manufacturing
    Profile provides a voluntary, risk-based approach for managing cybersecurity activities
    and cyber risk to manufacturing systems. The Manufacturing Profile is meant to
    complement but not replace current cybersecurity standards and industry guidelines
    that the manufacturer is embracing.'
