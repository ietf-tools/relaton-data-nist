abstract:
- content: 'The Public Safety Communications Research Division (PSCR) at NIST plays
    a primary role in research and development to impact public safety operational
    capabilities. PSCR''s mission is to bring advanced capabilities to first responders
    and have a measurable impact on their ability to protect and save lives and property.
    This report details the impacts of PSCR''s intramural and extramural programs
    across five leading indicators: Increasing Research Capacity, Disruptive Approaches
    and Technology, Standards, Products, and Public Safety Methods. As the PSCR program
    enters its final three years of allocated funding under the Middle Class Tax Relief
    and Job Creation Act of 2012, it aims to increase its dynamic impact on the development
    of standards, methodologies, and technologies that will make the next generation
    nationwide public safety broadband network a reality. PSCR will continue to document
    and report on the outcomes of its diverse research to ensure that technical advancements
    supported by the program are made available for all stakeholders to maximize the
    operational effectiveness of first responders.'
