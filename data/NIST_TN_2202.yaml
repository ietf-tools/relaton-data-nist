abstract:
- content: This report documents work performed by the U.S. National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
    (CPSC) under an interagency agreement in support of the Commission's effort to
    address the carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning hazard associated with consumer use
    of portable generators. This report documents the plan, developed by NIST and
    CPSC staff, for a computer simulation study performed by NIST and provides examples
    of the study results. CPSC staff will use the study's results to evaluate the
    effectiveness of CO hazard mitigation requirements that were adopted in two voluntary
    standards in 2018. These two ANSI-approved standards are ANSI/PGMA G300-2018,
    Safety and Performance of Portable Generators (referred to as PGMA G300) and UL
    2201, Standard for Carbon Monoxide (CO) Emission Rate of Portable Generators,
    Second Edition (referred to as UL 2201). Both voluntary standards have requirements
    for a system that will shut the generator off when specific CO concentrations
    are present near the generator. PGMA G300 also has other requirements, including
    a notification to alert the user of the presence of CO after the generator has
    shut off, while UL 2201 has a reduced CO emission rate requirement. The methodology
    of the simulation study was largely similar to that used by CPSC staff to evaluate
    the benefits of the proposed rule issued by the Commission in 2016 to address
    the hazard of CO poisoning from portable generators. This simulation study used
    the same forty buildings, weather conditions, and generator characteristics to
    study the rate at which the CO emitted from the generator accumulates in, transports
    within, and leaves the homes and detached garages for generators with and without
    the CO mitigation requirements prescribed in the voluntary standards. The plan
    involved performing approximately 140,000 simulations using NIST's indoor air
    quality modeling program CONTAM. This report presents the simulation plan and
    detailed CO and COHb simulation results for sample scenarios from two of the houses
    and one of the detached garages.
