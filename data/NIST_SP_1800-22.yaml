abstract:
- content: Many organizations provide employees the flexibility to use their personal
    mobile devices to perform work-related activities. An ineffectively secured personal
    mobile device could expose an organization or employee to data loss or a privacy
    compromise. Ensuring that an organizationâ€™s data is protected when it is accessed
    from personal devices poses unique challenges and threats. Allowing employees
    to use their personal mobile devices for work-related activities is commonly known
    as a bring your own device (BYOD) deployment. A BYOD deployment offers a convenient
    way to remotely access organizational resources, while avoiding the alternative
    of carrying both a work phone and personal phone. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice
    Guide demonstrates how organizations can use standards-based, commercially available
    products to help meet their BYOD security and privacy needs.
