abstract:
- content: The Intelligent Building Agents Laboratory (IBAL) has been designed and
    constructed to demonstrate the potential for distributed, intelligent software
    agents to perform optimization of control systems in commercial buildings. This
    technical note presents an assessment of the measurement uncertainty of instrumentation
    in the air system of the IBAL. The total uncertainty is calculated by combining
    this time-dependent variability with the uncertainty of the instrumentation.
