abstract:
- content: De-identification is a general term for any process of removing the association
    between a set of identifying data and the data subject. This document describes
    the use of de-identification with the goal of preventing or limiting disclosure
    risks to individuals and establishments while still allowing for the production
    of meaningful statistical analysis. Government agencies can use de-identification
    to reduce the privacy risk associated with collecting, processing, archiving,
    distributing, or publishing government data. Previously, NIST IR 8053, De-Identification
    of Personal Information, provided a detailed survey of de-identification and re-identification
    techniques. This document provides specific guidance to government agencies that
    wish to use de-identification. Before using de-identification, agencies should
    evaluate their goals for using de-identification and the potential risks that
    releasing de-identified data might create. Agencies should decide upon a data-sharing
    model, such as publishing de-identified data, publishing synthetic data based
    on identified data, providing a query interface that incorporates de-identification,
    or sharing data in non-public protected enclaves. Agencies can create a Disclosure
    Review Board to oversee the process of de-identification. They can also adopt
    a de-identification standard with measurable performance levels and perform re-identification
    studies to gauge the risk associated with de-identification. Several specific
    techniques for de-identification are available, including de-identification by
    removing identifiers, transforming quasi-identifiers, and generating synthetic
    data using models. People who perform de-identification generally use special-purpose
    software tools to perform the data manipulation and calculate the likely risk
    of re-identification. However, not all tools that merely mask personal information
    provide sufficient functionality for performing de-identification. This document
    also includes an extensive list of references, a glossary, and a list of specific
    de-identification tools, which is only included to convey the range of tools currently
    available and is not intended to imply a recommendation or endorsement by NIST.
