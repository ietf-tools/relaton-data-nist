abstract:
- content: 'Prior industry surveys and research studies have revealed that organizational
    security awareness programs may face a number of challenges, including lack of:
    leadership support; resources; and staff with sufficient background and skills
    to implement an effective and engaging program. However, no prior research has
    explored security awareness programs specifically in the United States (U.S.)
    government (federal) sector. To address this gap, NIST conducted a two-phase,
    mixed methods research study to understand the needs, challenges, and practices
    of federal security awareness programs. This report describes the research background
    and methodology, along with the characteristics of the participants, organizations,
    and programs represented in the study. Research results can serve as a resource
    for federal security awareness professionals, managers, and organizational decision
    makers to improve and advocate for their organizations'' security awareness programs.
    Results can also inform the development of federal security awareness guidance,
    policies, sharing forums, and initiatives meant to aid programs in becoming more
    effective. While focused on the U.S. government, findings may also have implications
    for organizational security awareness programs in other sectors.'
