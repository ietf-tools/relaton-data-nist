abstract:
- content: 'The 2023 National Institute of Standards and Technology Environmental
    Scan provides an analysis of key external factors that could impact NIST and the
    fulfillment of its mission in coming years. The analyses were conducted through
    three separate lenses: Societal & Political(Sec. 2), Investment & Geopolitical
    (Sec. 3), and Technology & Science (Sec. 4). Most of the issues discussed in the
    previous environmental scans conducted in 2018 and 2020 are still relevant, but
    a number of key issues have emerged in society that will impact NIST since the
    writing of those reports. Societal, political, financial, and workforce issues
    will challenge NIST to maintain and advance its leadership in metrology, standards,
    and technology. However, a broad range of emerging technology issues present opportunities
    for NIST to have significant impact in advancing the nationâ€™s innovation and industrial
    competitiveness.'
