abstract:
- content: 'Emergency and disaster situations are unavoidable. Earthquakes, severe
    weather, bomb threats, and war are an unfortunate reality. Firefighters, bomb
    technicians, and urban search and rescue specialists are the first to respond
    in emergency situations. These first responders risk their lives where remotely
    operated robots would be more suited for the dangers. Emergency response robots
    are designed for remote operation implying a wireless connection between the controller
    and robot. The performance of the wireless communication connection between controller
    and robot is typically non-ideal. Reflective and absorptive properties of the
    operational environment and interference degrade the communication system, limiting
    range, reliability, and timeliness. An affordable and effective method for evaluating
    the performance of emergency response robots under specific attenuated radio conditions
    is proposed in this paper. The method may be useful for continuing work on a current
    standard: E2855-12 Standard Test Method for Evaluating Emergency Response Robot
    Capabilities: Radio Communication: Non-Line-of-Sight Range[3] currently being
    pursued by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International
    Standards Committee on Homeland Security Applications.'
