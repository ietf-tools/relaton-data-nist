abstract:
- content: In this report we describe a novel framework for evaluation of video analytics
    which uses video quality metric prediction as a measurement of the system performance.
    This system is used to improve overall video analytics system performance. The
    primary concept of this approach is to create an evaluation infrastructure that
    can promote the study of video quality metrics, and at the same time promote the
    research of video analytics. The achievements in both domains will have significant
    impacts on many application areas, such as public safety, homeland security, video
    surveillance applications, geographic applications and entertainment video.
