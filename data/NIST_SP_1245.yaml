abstract:
- content: 'On March 18-19, 2019, NIST held a workshop on Large Outdoor Fire Modeling
    (LOFM) to assess the state of the art in computational fire modeling and to identify
    a set of research priorities for driving progress in the development of large
    outdoor fire models. This workshop was broadly concerned with large outdoor fires
    that have the potential to negatively impact communities or the environment. In
    this context, wildfires, wildland and wildlandurban interface (WUI) fires, post-earthquake
    fires, oil spill cleanup, and community-scale structural conflagrations may all
    be classified as large outdoor fires. The premise of the workshop was that modeling
    tools may assist in mitigating the large outdoor fire problem or at least in developing
    a better understanding of the problem. The group looked at the modeling problem
    in three different areas: (1) operational modeling, (2)forensic reconstruction,
    and (3) planning, such as prescribed burns or forest fuels management. Operational
    models mostly empirical rate of spread models were classified as running much
    faster than real time, with simple user interfaces. These models are useful for
    forecasting and generating large ensembles of fire scenarios for risk analysis.
    Forensic models usually need to be run at landscape scale to capture terrain features
    and incorporate weather effects. High-fidelity, physics-based models may be used
    for understanding detailed phenomena, forensics, or for planning purposes. The
    physics-based models tend to be limited by the level of resolution available for
    input parameters and by the stochastic and chaotic nature of real fire events.
    A survey of available models is presented in this report. Approximately 50 onsite
    and 20 online attendees participated in the workshop. Plenary presentations where
    given by Chris Lautenberger of REAX Engineering, Janice Coen of the National Center
    for Atmospheric Research, and Rod Linn of Los Alamos National Laboratory. These
    lectures laid out the state of the art in operational rate of spread models, fire-weather
    interaction, and physics-based models, respectively, providing a baseline for
    workshop discussions. Details of the workshop process are given in the report.
    Three breakout groups, each with a balanced makeup of fire-related expertise (from
    first responders to high-performance computing experts), convened to address user
    needs, identify research gaps in outdoor fire models, and to suggest a set of
    grand challenge problems to focus research efforts with a ten year horizon.'
