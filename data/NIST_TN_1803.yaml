abstract:
- content: During structural fire fighting operations, fire fighters wear protective
    gear to insulate them from high temperature environments, including hot combustion
    gases, burning surfaces, and thermal radiation. Current turnout gear insulates
    the fire fighter to such an extent, encapsulating his/her entire body, that it
    is difficult for each individual fire fighter to understand how hazardous or hot
    the thermal environment is. Therefore, the natural heat-sensing mechanism of the
    body is incapable of sensing the ambient temperature, possibly putting firefighters
    at risk. A thermal sensing device that attaches to the visor of the head gear
    is designed to restore situational awareness of the firefighter by showing varying
    heat intensity through different colored warning indicators in the firefighter
    s line of sight. Human factors evaluation of the performance of the warnings in
    the thermal sensing device was conducted in laboratory-scale (i.e., climatic chamber
    experiments) and in full-scale (i.e. fire experiments in ISO room) environments.
    This report describes the laboratory-scale experiments and a second report describes
    the fullscale fire experiments. A static oven, representing the conductive type
    of heat; a fire equipment evaluator, with high speed convective flow loop, and
    a radiant panel, with intense heat flux were used to conduct laboratory-scale
    experiments.
