abstract:
- content: The knowledge of material phases in chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni) stainless
    steel alloys is sometimes important during parts and structures fabrication processed
    with additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Laser-based powder bed fusion (LPBF)
    is one of these AM- process, which allowed to manufacture parts out of Cr-Ni stainless
    steel alloys. Mechanical behavior and microstructure of these LPBF manufactured
    steels are strongly dependent on their chemical composition and thermal conditions
    during the LPBF process as well as during the post process treatment. This current
    work is for users of laser-based PBF process to predict the material microstructure
    in Cr-Ni stainless steel alloys manufactured in a PBF process and help to develop
    guidelines for optimizing the microstructure in Cr-Ni stainless steel alloys and
    help to develop and to improve their manufacture process. This work outlines the
    use of established methods to predict the material microstructure of stainless
    steel weld metals for Cr-Ni stainless steel alloys manufactured by laser based
    Powder Bed Fusion Process. Predictions to the phase solidification in Cr-Ni stainless
    steel alloys were shown with the calculation of the ration between the chromium
    and nickel equivalent and inscribe these values into the phase reaction diagram
    helps to predict whether the solidification in a Cr-Ni stainless steel occurs
    either primary ferritic of austenitic. Inscribing these values of the chromium
    and nickel equivalent into the Schaeffler and DeLong diagram showed a strong effect
    of the nitrogen content, which led to a higher amount of retained austenite in
    the material microstructure, when the nitrogen content in the additively manufactured
    S17-4 PH increased. The stability of this retained austenite to decompose into
    the Cr-Ni stainless steel phase, such as martensite and cementite could be quantified
    with the calculation of the Md30 temperature and shown with the increase of the
    hardness after the as manufactured
