abstract:
- content: This report documents a series of time-averaged gas species measurements
    made along the centerline of methanol, ethanol, and acetone pool fires steadily
    burning in a quiescent environment. All gas species measurements are obtained
    using a Gas Chromatograph/ Mass Spectrometer System (GC/MS). Measurements were
    made at different heights along the centerline of the fire and repeated at least
    twice for each location. Gas species volume fractions were determined via the
    GC/MS using predetermined calibration factors. Soot mass fractions are simultaneously
    measured during the gas sampling process. The gas species volume and soot mass
    fractions are compared at different heights within the fire and across a variety
    of different fuels. Other fire parameters are measured as well, including time-averaged
    temperature measurements and mass burning rates.
