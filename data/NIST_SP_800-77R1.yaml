abstract:
- content: Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a widely used network layer security
    control for protecting communications. IPsec is a framework of open standards
    for ensuring private communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec
    configuration is usually performed using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol.
    This publication provides practical guidance to organizations on implementing
    security services based on IPsec so that they can mitigate the risks associated
    with transmitting sensitive information across networks. The document focuses
    on how IPsec provides network layer security services and how organizations can
    implement IPsec and IKE to provide security under different circumstances. It
    also describes alternatives to IPsec and discusses under what circumstances each
    alternative may be appropriate.
