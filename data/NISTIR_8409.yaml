abstract:
- content: This work evaluates the validity of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
    (CVSS) Version 3 ''base score'' equation in capturing the expert opinion of its
    maintainers. CVSS is a widely used industry standard for rating the severity of
    information technology vulnerabilities; it is based on human expert opinion. This
    study is important because the equation design has been questioned since it has
    features that are both non-intuitive and unjustified by the CVSS specification.
    If one can show that the equation reflects CVSS expert opinion, then that study
    justifies the equation and the security community can treat the equation as an
    opaque box that functions as described. This work shows that the CVSS base score
    equation closely though not perfectly represents the CVSS maintainers' expert
    opinion. The CVSS specification itself provides a measurement of error called
    ''acceptable deviation'' (with a value of 0.5 points). In this work, the distance
    between the CVSS base scores and the closest consistent scoring systems (ones
    that completely conform to the recorded expert opinion) is measured. The authors
    calculate that the mean scoring distance is 0.13 points and the maximum scoring
    distance is 0.40 points. The acceptable deviation was also measured to be 0.20
    points (lower than claimed by the specification). These findings validate that
    the CVSS base score equation represents the CVSS maintainers' domain knowledge
    to the extent described by these measurements.
