abstract:
- content: Risk Management is the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and
    taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Organizations use risk assessment,
    the first step in the risk management methodology, to determine the extent of
    the potential threat, vulnerabilities, and the risk associated with an information
    technology (IT) system. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate
    controls for reducing or eliminating risk during the risk mitigation process,
    the second step of risk management, which involves prioritizing, evaluating, and
    implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk
    assessment process.This guide provides a foundation for the development of an
    effective risk management program, containing both the definitions and the practical
    guidance necessary for assessing and mitigating risks identified within IT systems
    throughout their system development life cycle (SDLC). The ultimate goal is to
    help organizations to better manage IT-related mission risks.Organizations may
    choose to expand or abbreviate the comprehensive processes and steps suggested
    in this guide and tailor them to their site environment in managing IT-related
    mission risks. In addition, this guide provides information on the selection of
    cost-effective security controls. These controls can be used to mitigate risk
    for the better protection of mission-critical information and the IT systems that
    process, store, and carry this information.The third step in the process is continual
    evaluation and assessment. In most organizations, IT systems will continually
    be expanded and updated, their components changed, and their software applications
    replaced or updated with newer versions. In addition, personnel changes will occur
    and security policies are likely to change over time. These changes mean that
    new risks will surface and risks previously mitigated may again become a concern.
    Thus, the risk management process is ongoing and evolving.
