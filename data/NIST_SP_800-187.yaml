abstract:
- content: Cellular technology plays an increasingly large role in society as it has
    become the primary portal to the internet for a large segment of the population.
    One of the main drivers making this change possible is the deployment of 4th generation
    (4G) Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular technologies. This document serves as
    a guide to the fundamentals of how LTE networks operate and explores the LTE security
    architecture. This is followed by an analysis of the threats posed to LTE networks
    and supporting mitigations.
