abstract:
- content: The macOS Security Compliance Project (mSCP) provides resources that system
    administrators, security professionals, security policy authors, information security
    officers, and auditors can leverage to secure and assess macOS desktop and laptop
    system security in an automated way. This publication introduces the mSCP and
    gives an overview of the resources available from the project's GitHub site, which
    is continuously curated and updated to support each new release of macOS. The
    GitHub site provides practical, actionable recommendations in the form of secure
    baselines and associated rules. This publication also describes use cases for
    leveraging the mSCP content.
