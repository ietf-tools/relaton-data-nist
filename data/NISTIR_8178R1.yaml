abstract:
- content: This guide addresses the compliance requirements for basic cosmetics and
    soap. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) defines cosmetics as
    articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into,
    or otherwise applied to the human body ... for cleansing, beautifying, promoting
    attractiveness, or altering the appearance (FD&C Act, sec. 201(i)). Cosmetic products
    may include skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and
    facial make-up preparations, cleansing shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors,
    and deodorants, as well as any substance that is intended for use as a component
    of a cosmetic product.
