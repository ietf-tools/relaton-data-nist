abstract:
- content: 'This book presents the Proceedings of the DoE/NBS Workshop on Environmental
    Speciation and Monitoring Needs for Trace Metal-Containing Substances from Energy
    Related Processes held at the National Bureau of Standards , Gaithersburg, MD,
    on May 18-20, 1981. The Workshop was sponsored by the Office of Health and Environmental
    Research, DoE, and the Office of Recycled Materials, NBS. The volume contains
    refereed papers submitted by 24 invited speakers, along with substantially complete
    text of the discussion following the papers, edited by the Co-chairpersons. The
    Proceedings address three major topic areas forming the overall objective of the
    Workshop: (1) What are the general and specific types of metal- or metalloid-containing
    substances occurring in energy-related process materials such as coals, oil shales,
    and waste products. (2) What are the current status and future prospects of element-
    and compound-specific measurement methods suitable for speciation of trace (ppm,
    ppb) metal- and metalloid-containing substances transmitted to the environment
    by energy-processing or waste cycling technologies. (3) For what toxic molecular
    forms of speciated process effluents should biological dose-response data be generated
    to assure reliable environmental impact and monitoring measurements. Main questions
    focused on providing assurance that the speciation methods (or their development)
    fit basic bioassay criteria along with appropriate standard reference materials
    for meeting quantitative process and waste monitoring or control needs.'
