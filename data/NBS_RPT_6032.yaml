abstract:
- content: Comparison of calculated and measured values of transmission loss for tropospheric
    propagation paths shows that there is an appreciable amount of uncertainty in
    the prediction process. Departures of observed from predicted values may be regarded
    as normally distributed when expressed in decibels, and this paper considers methods
    of estimating these standard deviations. In order to predict the performance of
    a communication system over a given path, it is necessary to define the grade
    of service, the time availability of this grade of service and the reliability
    of the predictions. The short-term (within-the-hour) signal fading is conveniently
    included in the definition of the grade of service, in terms of a required hourly
    median r.m.s.-carrier to r.m.s.-noise ratio. Next, the time availability of a
    given grade of service is specified in terms of the percentage of hours in a year
    that this minimum carrier-to-noise ratio is exceeded. To determine the time availability
    it is necessary to obtain the distributions with time of hourly medians for the
    path with given geometrical and meteorological characteristics. In this paper
    the three concepts, grade of service, time availability, and reliability of prediction
    are brought together in a single graphical representation. The graph has two probability
    scales; the ordinate shows the percentage of hours service is available (time
    availability), and the abscissa shows the service probability (reliability of
    the prediction), where each curve corresponds to a system with given operating
    characteristics such as transmitter power, antenna size, etc. Each curve could
    therefore be labeled by a figure representing installation and operating costs,
    and various systems may thus be compared on the basis of cost versus probability
    of successful operation.
