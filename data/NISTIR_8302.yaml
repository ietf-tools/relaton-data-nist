abstract:
- content: 'The NIST Instrumented Charpy Analysis Software (NICAS) is a standalone
    LabVIEW1 program that can be used to analyze instrumented impact tests in accordance
    with the following international test standards: ASTM E2298-18 [1] and ISO 14556:2015
    [2]. It is also possible to perform some operations manually, i.e., not in strict
    accordance with the above cited standards. The software is provided free of charge
    in both raw LabVIEW code and executable (*.EXE) formats with an installer for
    PC platforms running Windows 7 or later.'
