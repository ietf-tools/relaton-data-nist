abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to assist organizations in planning and
    conducting technical information security tests and examinations, analyzing findings,
    and developing mitigation strategies. The guide provides practical recommendations
    for designing, implementing, and maintaining technical information security test
    and examination processes and procedures. These can be used for several purposes,
    such as finding vulnerabilities in a system or network and verifying compliance
    with a policy or other requirements. The guide is not intended to present a comprehensive
    information security testing and examination program but rather an overview of
    key elements of technical security testing and examination, with an emphasis on
    specific technical techniques, the benefits and limitations of each, and recommendations
    for their use.
