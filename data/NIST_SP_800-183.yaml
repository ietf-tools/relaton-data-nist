abstract:
- content: System primitives allow formalisms, reasoning, simulations, and reliability
    and security risktradeoffs to be formulated and argued. In this work, five core
    primitives belonging to most distributed systems are presented. These primitives
    apply well to systems with large amounts of data, scalability concerns, heterogeneity
    concerns, temporal concerns, and elements of unknown pedigree with possible nefarious
    intent. These primitives are the basic building blocks for a Network of Things
    (NoT), including the Internet of Things (IoT). This document offers an underlying
    and foundational understanding of IoT based on the realization that IoT involves
    sensing, computing, communication, and actuation. The material presented here
    is generic to all distributed systems that employ IoT technologies (i.e., things
    and networks). The expected audience is computer scientists, IT managers, networking
    specialists, and networking and cloud computing software engineers. To our knowledge,
    the ideas and the manner in which IoT is presented here is unique.
