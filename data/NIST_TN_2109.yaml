abstract:
- content: In this report, we document the models and dimensional traceability of
    our WR15 rectangular waveguide standards for performing multiline thru-reflect-line
    calibrations from 50 GHz to 75 GHz using vector network analyzers. We identify
    the equations used in our models of the transmission-line standards and present
    a method for determining a waveguide s metal conductivity using a closed-form
    solution relating it to the propagation constant. Next, we provide details of
    the traceable dimensional measurements and associated uncertainties of our WR15
    transmission line standards. And finally, we describe how our software, the NIST
    Microwave Uncertainty Framework, is used to implement physical models of calibration
    standards and propagate these systematic uncertainties to the calibrated scattering-parameters
    of a device under test. We include a measurement example for illustrative purposes.
