abstract:
- content: This document discusses issues that arise in the collection, dissemination,
    and use of datasets for use in biometric and forensic science research, and provides
    recommendations on how to best address the issues raised. A variety of factors
    should be considered when collecting data so that the resulting dataset is appropriate
    for use in testing or research, or when deciding whether an existing dataset is
    appropriate for a given purpose. This document does not address privacy and human
    subjects aspects of data collection. These topics will be addressed in forthcoming
    publications.
