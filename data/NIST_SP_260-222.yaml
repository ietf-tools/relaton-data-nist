abstract:
- content: The Gas Sensing Metrology Group at NIST provides accurate, stable gaseous
    standards for use in various types of emissions testing and environmental monitoring.
    The group develops and maintains the highest level of primary gas standards, which
    provide direct traceability to the International System of Units (SI). This traceability
    is then realized through the certification and dissemination of reference gas
    standards, such as NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRMs). Gas mixture SRMs
    are produced by a specialty gas company, analyzed by NIST against primary gas
    standards, and sold to customers to provide traceability for their gas measurements.
    This document provides an overview of the gas metrology program at NIST, and describes
    the general procedures which are used to develop and certify gas mixture SRMs.
