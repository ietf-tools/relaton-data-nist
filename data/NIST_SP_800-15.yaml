abstract:
- content: 'The Minimum Interoperability Specification for PKI Components (MISPC)
    supports interoperability for a large scale public key infrastructure (PKI) that
    issues, revokes and manages X.509 version 3 digital signature public key certificates
    and version 2 certificate revocation lists (CRLs). To the extent possible, this
    document adopts data formats and transaction sets defined in existing and evolving
    standards, such as ITU X.509 and the IETF''s Internet Public Key Infrastructure
    Using X.509 Certificates (PKIX) series. In this specification a PKI is broken
    into five components: certification authorities (CAs) that issue and revoke certificates;
    organizational registration authorities (ORAs) that vouch for the binding between
    public keys and certificate holder identities and other attributes; certificate
    holders that are issued certificates and can sign digital documents; clients that
    validate digital signatures and their certification paths from a known public
    key of a trusted CA; and repositories that store and make available certificates
    and CRLs.The MISPC supports both hierarchical and network trust models. In hierarchical
    models, trust is delegated by a CA when it certifies a subordinate CA. Trust delegation
    starts at a root CA that is trusted by every node in the infrastructure. IN network
    models, trust is established between any two CAs. The MISPC specifies the use
    of X.509 v3 extensions in certificates to explicitly manage trust relationships.This
    specification consists primarily of a profile of certificate and CRL extensions
    and a set of transactions. The transactions include: certification requests, certificate
    renewal, certificate revocation, and retrieval of certificates and CRLs from repositories.'
