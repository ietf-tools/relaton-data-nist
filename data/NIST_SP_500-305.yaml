abstract:
- content: This document details efforts undertaken by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) to develop measurements and a protocol for the evaluation
    of contactless (touchless) fingerprint acquisition devices. Contactless fingerprint
    capture differs fundamentally from legacy contact fingerprinting methods, and
    poses novel problems for image quality evaluation and challenges relative to interoperability
    with contact fingerprints that populate large repositories maintained by law enforcement
    and Federal Government organizations. For contact acquisition, the fingerprint
    impression is a first-order transfer of the 3D friction ridge structure to the
    recording surface. The third dimension of the curved finger surface is effectively
    removed by pressure against the planar recording surface. The 3D topography of
    the ridges and furrows are transferred with low ambiguity to the recording surface
    as dark ridges (points of contact) and lighter furrows (lesser or no contact).
    Contactless images by comparison, in most cases, are third-order renderings of
    an original photographic representation, itself a 2D optical projection of the
    3D structure of the finger. The appearance of this projection is subject to variability
    as low- or moderately-controlled lighting interacts with the 3D geometry of the
    finger, the friction ridge structure superimposed on the finger, and the geometry
    of the presentation of the finger to the contactless device. The photograph must
    then be subjected to various image processing methods to infer the ridge structure
    for rendering as a fingerprint similar in appearance to legacy contact captures.
    The rendering process is the source of numerous errors relative to contact captures.
    Despite problems with image quality, this early study finds contactless fingerprints
    of the devices examined to be usable in some applications, with qualifications,
    including one- to-many matching against small databases.
