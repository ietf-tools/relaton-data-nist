abstract:
- content: Many threats against end user devices, such as desktop and laptop computers,
    smart phones, personal digital assistants, and removable media, could cause information
    stored on the devices to be accessed by unauthorized parties. To prevent such
    disclosures of information, the information needs to be secured. This publication
    explains the basics of storage encryption, which is the process of using encryption
    and authentication to restrict access to and use of stored information. The appropriate
    storage encryption solution for a particular situation depends primarily upon
    the type of storage, the amount of information that needs to be protected, the
    environments where the storage will be located, and the threats that need to be
    mitigated. This publication describes three types of solutions⁰₄full disk encryption,
    volume and virtual disk encryption, and file/folder encryption⁰₄and makes recommendations
    for implementing and using each type. This publication also includes several use
    case examples, which illustrate that there are multiple ways to meet most storage
    encryption needs.
