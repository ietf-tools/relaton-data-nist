abstract:
- content: This project addresses the objectives of the Statement of Need number WPSON-17-20
    No/Low Global Warming Potential Alternatives to Ozone Depleting Refrigerants.
    Its goal is to identify and demonstrate performance of low global-warming-potential
    (GWP), non-flammable refrigerants to replace HFC-134a in military environmental
    control units (ECUs). This project is a follow-on to the limited-scope project
    WP-2740, which used thermodynamic cycle simulation models alone to screen over
    100 000 refrigerant blends and identified over 20 candidate HFC-134a replacements.
    In this study we narrow the pool of blend candidates down to three best fluids,
    verify experimentally their flammability behavior, demonstrate their performance
    through tests in a military ECU in environmental chambers at a wide range of operating
    conditions, and extrapolate the laboratory measured performance to ECUs equipped
    with optimized heat exchangers through first-principles-based simulations combined
    with machine-learning optimization methods. This Interim Report documents the
    preliminary work leading to the selection of three best blends. This work included
    refrigerant blend tests in a laboratory mini-breadboard heat pump apparatus, fundamental
    measurements and modeling of thermophysical properties, two-phase heat-transfer
    performance, and flammability behavior.
