abstract:
- content: The National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) in partnership and
    cooperation with the NIST Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) and the Weights
    and Measures Divisions of select U.S. States initiated the 2022 National Survey
    on 20 lb LPG (Propane) Cylinders that represents the current marketplace practice
    of manufacturing, filling, selling and exchanging 20 lb LPG cylinders. The survey
    determined the accuracy of the stamped tare weight (TW) to the actual tare weight
    by collecting contemporary data; evaluated the methods of sale, fill procedures,
    and price posting practices used at direct sale refilling locations; and determined
    the net weight compliance when performing a cylinder exchange and how much product
    remains after consumers perform an exchange. This study was designed to examine,
    validate, and ultimately ensure Equity in the Marketplace, by confirming accuracy
    and fair competition in commercial transactions of LPG products based on product
    weight or other measures (e.g., flat fees). For all the evaluated cylinders (9,482
    new and 822 used cylinders), nearly half (44.3%) of new cylinders and significantly
    less (32.0%) of used cylinders were in compliance with existing tare weight requirements.
    With a shift to more lenient DOT regulations to be enacted on January 1, 2023,
    nearly all of these new cylinders (98.4%) and a significant majority of the used
    cylinders (65.7 %) would be in compliance. A total of 1,559 direct sale refilling
    locations across 18 states were evaluated to determine how 20 lb propane cylinders
    were being sold, posted or advertised, and if the safe fill level was being verified
    through proper procedures. A range of selling approaches (by weight, volume, flat
    fees) were observed, and nearly 10 % of locations are improperly verifying the
    safe fill level of cylinders. Of the cylinder exchange locations that were surveyed,
    only 75% passed the overall individual package requirements for accurate net contents
    and 1.1% of cylinders were found to exceed the safe fill level of 20 lbs. An average
    of 25 % of consumers return more than 1 lb of propane when they return a cylinder.
    Of these, approximately 8% returned cylinders with over 5 lbs of propane. The
    results provided in this report are to assist and inform the States, propane industry,
    consumer and workplace protection organizations, and Federal agency stakeholders
    of the present needs and opportunities to establish improved procedures and oversight
    of the manufacturing, refilling, reselling and consumer-based transactions for
    LPG cylinders. States should consider performing more routine inspections and
    enforcement beyond the 20 lb cylinders, as similar issues and concerns may exist
    for different sized cylinders and other types of compressed gasses. States should
    review and develop programs to ensure the accuracy of scales being used at the
    plant and at direct sale refilling locations. Industry and their trade associations
    should also consider conducting a root cause analysis to determine any underlying
    processes or procedures that may be contributing to non-compliance. Improving
    the manufacturing process and safety considerations while also informing and educating
    consumers on potentially wasted product will ensure improved safety and marketplace
    equity for businesses and consumers alike.
