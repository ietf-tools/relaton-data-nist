abstract:
- content: Fractography is a powerful tool for the analysis of fractured glasses and
    ceramics. It is applicable to fractures created under controlled conditions in
    the laboratory and to component failures in service. Fractography can identify
    the cause of failure and can even provide quantitative information about the loading
    conditions. The goal of this Guide is to make fractographic analysis of brittle
    materials less an art and more an engineering practice for scientists and engineers.
    This guide emphasizes practical approaches for problem solving and failure analyses.
