abstract:
- content: This publication is a colorful poster illustrating the relationships of
    the International System of Units (SI) derived units with special names and symbols
    and the seven traditional base units. The diagram is aligned with the BIPM SI
    Brochure, 9th edition and NIST SP 330, The International System of Units (SI),
    2019 edition. The previous edition of this diagram was published on the back cover
    of NIST SP 811, Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI), 2008
    edition. The traditional SI base unit symbols are shown within rectangle shapes,
    with the unit name shown above the corresponding rectangle. The derived units
    with special names are shown in circle shapes, with the unit symbol and name within
    the circle. An expression for the derived unit in terms of other units shown in
    parenthesis. Derived units without special names are not illustrated. In the diagram,
    the derivation of each derived unit is indicated by arrows that bring in units
    in the numerator (solid lines) and units in the denominator (broken lines), as
    appropriate. The unit degree 'Celsius,' which is equal in magnitude to the unit
    kelvin, is used to express Celsius temperature t, defined by the quantity equation
    t = T - T0, where T0 = 273.15 K, the ice point. This equality is indicated in
    the diagram by the symbol K in the degree C circle. The numerical value of a Celsius
    temperature t expressed in degrees Celsius is given by the equation below 'CELSIUS
    TEMPERATURE.' A difference or interval of temperature may be expressed in kelvins
    or in degrees Celsius.
