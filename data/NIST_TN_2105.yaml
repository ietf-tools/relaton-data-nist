abstract:
- content: The Camp Fire ignited on the morning of November 8, 2018, in Pulga, CA.
    Fanned by high winds, the fire spread quickly through wildlands and burned into
    the wildland-urban interface (WUI) communities of Concow, Paradise, and Magalia,
    CA. Within hours, thousands of structures were destroyed as over 30,000 residents
    evacuated the area. The Camp Fire burned for 18 days, consumed 62,053 ha (153,336
    ac), destroyed or damaged 19,531 structures, and resulted in 85 fatalities. As
    part of the NIST Disaster and Failure Studies Program, a reconnaissance team was
    deployed to Butte County, CA to collect any perishable data, along with preliminary
    field data which would be used to assess the need and ability to fully reconstruct
    this fire. A multiagency team consisting of NIST, US Forest Service, and Federal
    Emergency Management Agency members worked closely with the California Department
    of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) incident command. Data collected from
    two deployments, totaling 18 days in the field, were used in a preliminary assessment
    of the incident to determine the need for a more comprehensive case study research
    effort. The reconnaissance deployment team determined that the Camp Fire was unique
    in terms of the extreme fire behavior, losses, evacuation and notification challenges.
    Based on the unique opportunities to better understand the behavior and response
    to wildland-urban interface fires, and the availability of data to support in-depth
    studies, the team recommended that a more comprehensive study be undertaken.
