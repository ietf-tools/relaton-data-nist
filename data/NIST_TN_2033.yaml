abstract:
- content: This report quantifies the influence of inorganic fullerene-like tungsten
    disulfide (IF-WS2) nanoparticles on the pool-boiling performance of R134a/polyolester
    mixtures on a commercial (Turbo-ESP) boiling surface. Tungsten disulfide nanoparticles,
    of roughly 150 nm, were used at a 15 % mass fraction in a base polyolester lubricant
    to produce the test nanolubricant. The nanolubricant was mixed with R134a at a
    1 % mass fraction. The study showed that the nanolubricant caused an average 37
    % degradation in the boiling heat flux as compared to R134a/neat-lubricant boiling
    on a reentrant cavity surface at the same superheat. Similarly, boiling with R134a/neat-lubricant
    caused, on average, a 27 % degradation in the boiling heat flux as compared to
    pure R134a boiling and the same superheat. An analysis was presented which showed
    that the nanoparticles were too large and too dense to promote a boiling enhancement.
    In addition, the fullerene-like structure and the large size encouraged nanoparticle
    settling, which presumably filled cavities of the boiling surface leading toadditional
    boiling degradations.
