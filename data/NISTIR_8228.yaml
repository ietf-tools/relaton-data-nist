abstract:
- content: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly evolving and expanding collection
    of diverse technologies that interact with the physical world. Many organizations
    are not necessarily aware of the large number of IoT devices they are already
    using and how IoT devices may affect cybersecurity and privacy risks differently
    than conventional information technology (IT) devices do. The purpose of this
    publication is to help federal agencies and other organizations better understand
    and manage the cybersecurity and privacy risks associated with their individual
    IoT devices throughout the devices lifecycles. This publication is the introductory
    document providing the foundation for a planned series of publications on more
    specific aspects of this topic.
