abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology has issued its first
    Standard Reference Materials for elemental analysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
    The custom designed PVC blends contain elements regulated in consumer products
    by the United States, the European Union, and other governments worldwide. The
    regulated elements are antimony, arsenic, barium, bromine, cadmium, chromium,
    lead, mercury, and selenium. Also, present in the PVC blend are elements from
    performance additives: calcium, sulfur, and tin; and from contaminants: copper,
    and iron. The development and certification project was designed and coordinated
    by NIST with technical assistance from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission,
    Underwriters'' Laboratories and the University of Washington Physics Department.
    This report describes how the PVC blends were designed, manufactured, packaged,
    analyzed, and value-assigned. Users will find descriptions of material heterogeneity
    testing and information from several test methods used for quantitative analyses
    of the PVC blends. The SRMs are available for purchase with one unit consisting
    of a single bottle containing 25 g of extruded pellets. In addition to describing
    the development of these SRMs, this report describes a process for creating calibrations
    for X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with mass fraction values traceable to the
    International System of Units using NIST SRM 3100 series, single element, spectrometric
    solutions. After the issuance of the SRMs, they were analyzed to obtain the mass
    fraction values for hexavalent chromium using a new, high-resolution X-ray emission
    method. The new method is described briefly with reference given to a detailed
    journal publication.'
