abstract:
- content: Robot arms onboard mobile bases, or mobile manipulators, are advancing
    and measurement of these systems is critical for robust safety and performance.
    As mobile manipulators flexibly fixture (i.e., do not fasten) to a worktable or
    object, they require advanced systems to measure how well they can perform tasks,
    such as assembly or inspection. The National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has developed a measurement concept that uses the NIST-designed, Reconfigurable
    Mobile Manipulator Artifact (RMMA) as the worktable/object. The RMMA includes
    fiducials with relatively high uncertainty, as compared to the mobile manipulator
    pose performance, that are measured using a mobile manipulator wielded camera
    or laser retroreflector sensor as the end-effector. The intent of developing the
    RMMA is for mobile manipulator manufacturers, users, and researchers to perform
    in-situ measurement during production or research for frequent system calibration.
    This paper describes the RMMA design and past RMMA evaluation using an automatic
    guided vehicle and a mobile robot, each supporting a six degree-of-freedom industrial
    robot arm, and RMMA/mobile manipulator ground truth measurement using an optical
    tracking system, also with relatively high uncertainty as compared to the mobile
    manipulator.
