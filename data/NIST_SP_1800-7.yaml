abstract:
- content: Situational awareness, in the context of this guide, is the understanding
    of one's environment and the ability to predict how it might change due to various
    factors. As part of their current cybersecurity efforts, some electric utilities
    monitor physical, operational, and information technology (IT) separately. According
    to energy sector stakeholders, many utilities are currently assessing a more comprehensive
    approach to situational awareness, which, through increased real-time or near
    real-time cybersecurity monitoring, can enhance the resilience of their operations.
    The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) built a laboratory environment to explore an
    example solution that can be used by energy sector companies to alert their staff
    to potential or actual cyber attacks directed at the grid. The security characteristics
    in our situational awareness platform are informed by guidance and best practices
    from standards organizations, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and North
    American Electric Reliability Corporation's (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection
    (CIP) Version 5 standards. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates
    how organizations can use commercially available products that can be integrated
    with an organization's existing infrastructure. The combination of these products
    provides a converged view of all sensor data within the utility's network systems,
    including IT, operational, cyber, and physical access control systems, which often
    exists in separate 'silos.' The example solution is packaged as a 'how to' guide
    that demonstrates implementation of standardsbased cybersecurity technologies
    in the real world and based on risk management. The guide may help inform electric
    utilities in their efforts to gain situational awareness efficiencies. Doing so
    may enable faster monitoring, identification, and response to incidents while
    also saving research and proof-ofconcept costs for the sector and its ratepayers
    and customers.
