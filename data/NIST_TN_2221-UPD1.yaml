abstract:
- content: 'This tutorial is a guide on how to implement the NIST infiltration correlations
    [1] into EnergyPlus building energy simulation software for the US Department
    of Energy prototype commercial buildings. The implementation can also be generalized
    to other building energy simulation software and other building models. Revision
    is documented in Appendix B: Change Log.'
