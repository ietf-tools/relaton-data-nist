abstract:
- content: 'In the fall of 2019, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) funded threes studies to better understand equity and inclusivity. This
    report documents phase two of a three phased sequential, exploratory mixed methods
    study designed to provide an in-depth look at the population of NIST federal employees
    to identify factors, attitudes, and processes that might result in gender- specific
    barriers at NIST. Phase 1 analyzed human resources demographic data, compensation
    data, and performance data of NIST federal employees from 2011 to 2019 to determine
    any relevant trends. Phase 1 informed the development of an in-depth interview
    protocol designed to identify the differences, if any, in the ways in which men
    and women experience work at NIST. A total of 40 (36 female and 4 male) participants
    were interviewed. Three interconnected themes emerged in the data: 1) a culture
    at NIST that creates a Chilly Climate for women; 2) gendered experiences that
    contribute to and are outcomes of that chilly climate; and 3) gendered outcomes
    that influence women s experiences in the organization. The culture has evolved
    from NIST s scientific roots, scientific excellence, a strong belief in meritocracy,
    and as a Federal agency. Each of these characteristics contribute to a gendered
    social structure and the perception that change is not needed. This backdrop sets
    the stage for the characterizations of NIST from the interviews as a Boys Club
    and an Elitist environment. The radically different perspectives of men and women
    based in the culture result in experiences and outcomes that provide advantages
    and opportunities for men while erecting barriers to survival for women, including
    isolation and possibly exclusion. These barriers result in consequences of discrimination
    as well as lack of trust and resignation. Participant quotes are used as exemplars
    to provide details related to each of these themes. Overall, the interviews demonstrate
    that women and men experience a very different NIST.'
