abstract:
- content: 'NIST has constructed a Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility that
    will be used as a testbed for investigating the measurement science related to
    systems, components, and operations that will lead to homes that generate as much
    energy over a course of a year through onsite renewable means as is consumed within
    the facility. The facility contains hundreds of sensors that are used to monitor
    the overall performance of the home along with its major systems: heating and
    cooling, electrical, ventilation, hot water, lighting, and photovoltaics. Additionally,
    approaches have been implemented to monitor the indoor thermal conditions, indoor
    air quality, and outdoor conditions. This document describes the monitoring approaches
    implemented in the facility to enable accurate measures of the performance of
    the systems within the facility and the resulting indoor environmental quality.'
