abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established
    the Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) for communities across the world to use
    as collaboration platform in their pursuit of deploying Internet of Things (IoT)
    and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to improve the quality of life for residents.
    The GCTC''s overarching goals are to enable standardization and interoperability
    for these IoT and CPS, and to make them scalable and replicable for the widest
    possible use. The Smart Agriculture and Rural SuperCluster is part of this GCTC
    effort. On February 19, 2020, this SuperCluster conducted a workshop in Phoenix,
    Arizona to further refine its blueprint for smart agriculture and rural areas.
    The workshop ultimately sought to develop a consensus-based smart cities and communities
    framework and best practices, which could subsequently inform widespread smart
    agriculture and rural initiatives. The workshop included five panels, which addressed
    the following topics: connecting rural places to broadband; smart agriculture;
    funding and financing; farm field mapping; and improving rural outcomes with broadband
    access. In each area, experts provided wide-ranging perspectives. Workshop participants
    then divided into three groups to discuss challenges for the following areas:
    smart agriculture, farm field mapping, and improving rural outcomes with broadband
    access. Spokespersons for each group reported the results to all workshop participants
    in a plenary session and for possible inclusion in the blueprint and framework.'
