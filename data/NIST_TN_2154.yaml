abstract:
- content: 'In January 2000, Noah Kalina began taking a photograph of himself every
    day and has continued for more than 20 years. A time-lapse video of his images
    can be seen online: EveryDay. These images, and images from similar projects,
    provide us with interesting opportunities to explore the effects of time lapse
    on iris recognition employed on images that were not originally intended for iris
    recognition. NIST obtained a license from Kalina to use a subset (7 half years
    from 2009-2015) of original, high resolution, digital images in biometric studies.
    This paper is our first published analysis of those images. Our license does not
    permit redistribution of the high resolution images. Our analysis demonstrates
    that over a period of at least 6 years, even though the majority of the images
    in this dataset did not provide solid matches, there are instances where mated
    iris image pairs from visible light images that were not obtained for the purpose
    of iris recognition match with match scores corresponding to a false match rate
    of 0:1% at a true accept rate of 1% . Though such performance is not useful in
    applications such as access control, there are cases where it may be useful. We
    note that the algorithms used in this analysis were not designed to work with
    the iris images that we extracted from the EveryDay project.'
