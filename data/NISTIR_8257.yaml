abstract:
- content: In September 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity
    held a fingerprint data collection as part of the Nail to Nail Fingerprint Challenge.
    Thousands of latent fingerprint images collected at the Challenge were searched
    against rolled-equivalent fingerprints with an automated friction ridge identification
    system. These searches yielded poor results. It was hypothesized that the size
    of the enrollment set might be to blame for the weak performance. This supplemental
    report varied the size of the enrollment set to test the hypothesis
