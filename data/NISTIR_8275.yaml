abstract:
- content: 'Access time generally describes the time associated with the establishment
    of a talk path upon user request to speak and has been identifed as a key component
    of quality of experience (QoE) in communications. NIST''s Public Safety Communications
    Research (PSCR) Division developed a method to measure and quantify the access
    time of any push-to-talk (PTT) communication system. This measurement method is
    a follow-on development to the mouth-to-ear (M2E) latency measurement system presented
    in Ref. [1]. Here, a broad defnition of access time is created that is applicable
    across multiple PTT technologies. In this paper, a speech intelligibility-based
    access delay measurement system is introduced. This system measures the Modifed
    Rhyme Test (MRT) intelligibility of a target word based on when PTT was pushed
    within a predefned message. It relies only on speech going into and coming out
    of a voice communications system and PTT timing, so it functions as a fair platform
    to compare different technologies. Example measurements were performed across
    the following land mobile radio (LMR) technologies: analog direct and conventional
    modes, and digital Project 25 (P25) direct, trunked Phase 1, and trunked Phase
    2 modes.'
