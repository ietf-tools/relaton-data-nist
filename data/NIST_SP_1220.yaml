abstract:
- content: NIST hosted workshop, Future Needs for Reducing the Fire Hazard of Materials,
    provided an opportunity for worlds experts to come together to discuss the challenges
    associated with reducing the fire hazards of existing and future products that
    compose the built and manufactured environment. A major product of the workshop
    is a prioritized list of research needs, applications, and guidance for implementing
    a research strategy to address these fire risks. This workshop report summarizes
    the results of the workshop and include the following recommendations. The workshop
    report recommends that research on Cross-Cutting topics should be considered as
    the highest priority. Real Fire Behaviors Bench-Scale Tools Engineered Fire Safe
    Products Computational Tools The workshop report recommends that the Cross-Cutting
    research should target Priority Applications in order to have the greatest impact
    on fire losses. Residential Upholstered Furniture Residential Buildings in WUI
