abstract:
- content: As individuals and communities interact in and with an environment that
    is increasingly virtual they are often vulnerable to the commodification of their
    digital exhaust. Concepts and behavior that are ambiguous in nature are captured
    in this environment, quantified, and used to categorize, sort, recommend, or make
    decisions about people's lives. While many organizations seek to utilize this
    information in a responsible manner, biases remain endemic across technology processes
    and can lead to harmful impacts regardless of intent. These harmful outcomes,
    even if inadvertent, create significant challenges for cultivating public trust
    in artificial intelligence (AI). SP 1270 is a NIST Artificial Intelligence publication
    and should be read in conjunction with all publications in the NIST AI Series,
    which was established in January 2023.
