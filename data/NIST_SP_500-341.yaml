abstract:
- content: The SATE VI report presents the results of a security-focused bug finding
    evaluation exercise carried out from 2018 to 2023 on various code bases using
    static analysis tools. Existing bugs were extracted from bug tracker reports and
    the CVE/NVD database, and additional bugs were injected using automated tools
    and manual analysis. The results of this exercise showed significant variability
    across tool effectiveness, depending on the test cases, bug classes, and bug complexity
    involved. The report discusses the shortcomings and difficulties encountered during
    the bug injection process, which marginally impeded the efficiency of the evaluation.
    The report emphasizes the correlation between high code complexity and tool difficulty
    in identifying bugs. Recall and discrimination rates were lower for the convoluted
    C Track than the considerably less complex Java Track. Across all languages and
    code bases, tools found bugs with lower complexity more readily than bugs with
    higher complexity. Finding rates varied for different bug classes, in line with
    the inherent complexity of each bug class (e.g., recall for simpler initialization
    errors was greater than on more intricate buffer errors). The report discusses
    the shortcomings of the bug injection process. Regardless of the test case, injected
    bugs were not found by tools at the same rate as existing bugs, implying that
    their quality needs to improve. The report also includes a summary of the Ockham
    Sound Analysis Criteria track, which focused on tools that do not report false
    positives or false negatives. The SATE VI report concludes that static analysis
    is a useful technique to find real security bugs in large code bases. The right
    set of tools, used properly, can help increase code quality and security. Potential
    users should test a tool or set of tools on their own code base before using them
    in production. The metrics presented in SATE VI are suitable for assessing tool
    fitness for such a use case.
