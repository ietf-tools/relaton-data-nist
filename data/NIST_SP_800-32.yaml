abstract:
- content: This publication was developed to assist agency decision-makers in determining
    if a PKI is appropriate for their agency, and how PKI services can be deployed
    most effectively within a Federal agency. It is intended to provide an overview
    of PKI functions and their applications. Additional documentation will be required
    to fully analyze the costs and benefits of PKI systems for agency use, and to
    develop plans for their implementation. This document provides a starting point
    and references to more comprehensive publications.
