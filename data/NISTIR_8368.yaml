abstract:
- content: The metrological term quantity value in various forms has conflicting interpretations.
    Standardization of the vocabulary of metrology has not ended the confusion. This
    report provides a historical trace of how the inconsistency arose and then describes
    how it has hindered international standards work, eroded conceptual integrity,
    and made the communication of software design concepts more difficult.
