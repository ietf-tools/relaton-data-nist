abstract:
- content: The Computer Security Division at the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology is interested in promoting the security of implementations of cryptographic
    primitives. This security depends not only on the theoretical properties of the
    primitives but also on the ability to withstand attacks on their implementations.
    It is thus important to mitigate breakdowns that result from differences between
    ideal and real implementations of cryptographic algorithms. This document overviews
    the possibility of implementing cryptographic primitives using threshold schemes,
    where multiple components contribute to the operation in a way that attains the
    desired security goals even if f out of n of its components are compromised. There
    is also an identified potential in providing resistance against side-channel attacks,
    which exploit inadvertent leakage from real implementations. Security goals of
    interest include the secrecy of cryptographic keys, as well as enhanced integrity
    and availability, among others. This document considers challenges and opportunities
    related to standardization of threshold schemes for cryptographic primitives.
    It includes examples illustrating security tradeoffs under variations of system
    model and adversaries. It enumerates several high-level characterizing features
    of threshold schemes, including the types of threshold, the communication interfaces
    (with the environment and between components), the executing platform (e.g., single
    device vs. multiple devices) and the setup and maintenance requirements. The document
    poses a number of questions, motivating aspects to take into account when considering
    standardization. A particular challenge is the development of criteria that may
    help guide a selection of threshold cryptographic schemes. An open question is
    deciding at what level each standard should be defined (e.g., specific base techniques
    vs. conceptualized functionalities) and which flexibility of parametrization they
    should allow. Suitability to testing and validation of implementations are also
    major concerns to be addressed. Overall, the document intends to support discussion
    about standardization, including motivating an engagement from stakeholders. This
    is a step towards enabling threshold cryptography within the US federal government
    and beyond.
