abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration
    with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted research to define and
    recommend an interoperable data solution to assist law enforcement in acquiring
    and analyzing digital video evidence from disparate systems. This document supplements
    the recommendation developed in NISTIR 8161. Recommendation: Closed Circuit Television
    (CCTV) Digital Video Export Profile Level 0. This supplement describes the research
    activities, methods, and results that led to the recommended standards profile.
    It also provides web links to the sample files used to conduct the research and
    validate implementation of the recommendation. NIST welcomes and seeks continued
    industry and other stakeholder comments concerning the initial (Level 0) recommendation
    and potential future enhancements. NIST looks forward to identifying and working
    with the pertinent standards community to move the recommendation into a formal
    standard that becomes adopted widely by industry.'
