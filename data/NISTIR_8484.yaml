abstract:
- content: The U.S. science and research ecosystem retains its leadership by actively
    engaging with the global community through the conduct of mutually beneficial
    collaborative research and the welcoming of international scientists. Coupled
    with that, the national and economic security of the United States depends on
    effective risk management practices for organizations that engage in international
    collaborative research to protect against undue foreign influence and interference.
    The National Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST) Safeguarding Science
    Research Security Framework (“Framework”) establishes guidance to assist the U.S.
    science and research community [e.g., U.S. Government (USG), academia, and industry]
    across the broad spectrum of international science and technology activities as
    well as Federal funding initiatives. This Framework is designed to enable organizations
    to implement a mission-focused, integrated, risk-balanced program through the
    application of research security principles and best practices that fosters the
    safeguarding of international science while mitigating risks to the integrity
    of the open collaborative environment. This Framework is a living document and
    will continue to be updated and improved as its users provide feedback on implementation
    of review procedures or to address new or emerging risks. This will ensure it
    is meeting the needs of Research Security practitioners in a dynamic and challenging
    environment of new threats, risks, and creative solutions.
