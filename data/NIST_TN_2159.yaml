abstract:
- content: The focus of this work provides a library of actual long-term evolution
    (LTE) user equipment (UE) emissions with sufficient time resolution and dynamic
    range for use in spectrum sharing, and interference susceptibility studies. National
    Advanced Spectrum and Communications Test Network (NASCTN)'s AWS-3 LTE impacts
    on AMT study required the use of LTE waveforms from advanced wireless services
    3 (AWS-3) equipment for playback in a susceptibility analysis. Thus, National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the NASCTN program office commissioned
    the work as part of the Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB) proposed and NASCTN steering
    committee approved test request to investigate the impact of LTE activities on
    aeronautical mobile telemetry (AMT) links. The recordings of the UE emissions
    are performed in the NIST Broadband Interoperability Testbed (NBIT) facility,
    where under laboratory conditions, a single UE (and subsequently a second UE)
    are in connection to a fully emulated LTE network with a carrier grade evolved
    Node B (eNB). NBIT's hybrid radio frequency (RF) testbed allows for a radiated
    free-space connection to the UE in conjunction with a cabled user equipment traffic
    generator (UTG) for control of cell loading conditions.
