abstract:
- content: 'Currently, there is a limited understanding of the costs related to suboptimal
    design and production information in discrete manufacturing. There is incomplete
    information on how engineers and other staff use their time. Additionally, the
    rate and cause of defective or deficient products is not tracked at the industry
    level. The frequency and impact of low-quality design data on product research
    and development is not clear. Further, it isn t clear to what extent improved
    process modeling can improve efficiency. This report focuses on the costs and
    losses associated with inadequate design/modeling information and data in discrete
    manufacturing. This includes: Product models (e.g., CAD/CAM), Simulation models
    of manufacturing processes, Interoperability between software platforms.'
