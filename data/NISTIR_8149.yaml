abstract:
- content: When supported by trust frameworks, identity federations provide a secure
    method for leveraging shared identity credentials across communities of similarly-focused
    online service providers. This document explores the concepts around trust frameworks
    and identity federations and provides topics to consider in their development
    and implementation.
