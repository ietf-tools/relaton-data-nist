abstract:
- content: In this report transmission loss data in the 7 50-900 Mc/s range from three
    long knife-edge diffraction paths (in Colorado, Alaska, and Europe) are evaluated
    and analyzed in terms of power fading (long-term variability) and short-term variability
    represented by prolonged space-wave fadeouts. A comparison is made of calculated
    and measured cumulative distributions of hourly median transmission loss values.
    It appears that long-term variability over a knife-edge diffraction path can be
    estimated by convoluting the distributions of hourly medians for the two component
    line-of-sight paths, and that short-term variations represented by space-wave
    fadeouts are more prevalent when substantial phase interference due to ground
    reflections in the vicinity of the terminal is likely to exist.
