abstract:
- content: The computation of the elastic registration of two simple curves in higher
    dimensions and therefore of the elastic shape distance between them has been investigated
    by Srivastava et al. Assuming the first curve has one or more starting points,
    and the second curve has only one, they accomplish the computation, one starting
    point of the first curve at a time, by minimizing an L2 type distance between
    them based on alternating computations of optimal diffeomorphisms of the unit
    interval and optimal rotation matrices that reparametrize and rotate, respectively,
    one of the curves. We recreate the work by Srivastava et al., but in contrast
    to it, again for curves in any dimension, we present a Dynamic Programming algorithm
    for computing optimal diffeomorphisms that is linear, and justify in a purely
    algebraic manner the usual algorithm for computing optimal rotation matrices,
    the Kabsch-Umeyama algorithm, which is based on the computation of the singular
    value decomposition of a matrix. In addition, we minimize the L2 type distance
    with a procedure that alternates computations of optimal diffeomorphisms with
    successive computations of optimal rotation matrices for all starting points of
    the first curve. Carrying out computations this way is not only more efficient
    all by itself, but, if both curves are closed, allows applications of the Fast
    Fourier Transform for computing successively in an even more efficient manner,
    optimal rotation matrices for all starting points of the first curve.
