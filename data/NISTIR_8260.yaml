abstract:
- content: In a previous special publication, NIST provided guidance for the compression
    of 1000 ppi fingerprint images using Part I of the JPEG 2000 standard. The present
    document extends the Guidance to the compression of 1000 ppi palm and whole-hand
    images. The NIST Spectral Image Validation Verification (SIVV) metric is used
    to determine JPEG 2000 compression ratios at which palm and hand images exhibit
    spectral fidelity to non-compressed source images comparable to that exhibited
    by fingerprint images compressed at 10:1. The investigators discuss the effect
    of untextured regions (i.e. large areas of low-texture or white space) in enabling
    compression ratios as high as 12:1 for palms and 22:1 for whole hand images as
    indicated by the spectral analysis. However, they note several factors that advise
    against deviating from the compression ratio recommended in the Guidance. Hence,
    NIST recommends that a single compression ratio, 10:1, be applied to all friction
    ridge impression types to ensure interoperability, in general, and support of
    latent matching, in particular.
