abstract:
- content: This publication describes the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and provides
    guidelines for applying the RMF to information systems and organizations. The
    RMF provides a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for managing security
    and privacy risk that includes information security categorization; control selection,
    implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations; and
    continuous monitoring. The RMF includes activities to prepare organizations to
    execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. The RMF also promotes
    near real-time risk management and ongoing information system and common control
    authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; provides
    senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make efficient,
    cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions
    and business functions; and incorporates security and privacy into the system
    development life cycle. Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management
    processes at the system level to risk management processes at the organization
    level. In addition, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the controls
    implemented within an organization's information systems and inherited by those
    systems.
