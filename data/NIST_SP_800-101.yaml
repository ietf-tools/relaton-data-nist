abstract:
- content: 'Forensic specialists periodically encounter unusual devices and new technologies
    outside of traditional computer forensics. Cell phones are an emerging area with
    such characteristics. The objective of this guide is twofold: to help organizations
    evolve appropriate policies and procedures for dealing with cell phones, and to
    prepare forensic specialists to contend with new circumstances involving cell
    phones, when they arise. This guide provides an in-depth look into cell phones
    and explains associated technologies and their effect on the procedures followed
    by forensic specialists. It also discusses procedures for the preservation, acquisition,
    examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on cell phones,
    as well as available forensic software tools that support those activities.'
