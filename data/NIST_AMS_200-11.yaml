abstract:
- content: This guide presents techniques for evaluating manufacturing investments
    from the perspective of environmentally sustainable manufacturing by pairing economic
    methods of investment analysis with environmental aspect of manufacturing, including
    manufacturing processes. The methods are based on ASTM E3200 and, although the
    focus is on manufacturing, they can be applied under other circumstances (e.g.,
    construction industry investments, agriculture, or mining). The economic techniques
    include net present value, internal rate of return, payback period, and hurdle
    rate. The guide also includes sensitivity analyses with a focus on Monte Carlo
    techniques. The methods presented can be used by manufacturers, regardless of
    size or complexity, to make environmentally sustainable decisions, including but
    not limited to whether to embark on an investment, discontinue a manufacturing
    line, invest or re-invest in a new project or factory.
