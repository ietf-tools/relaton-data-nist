abstract:
- content: Big Data is a term used to describe the large amount of data in the networked,
    digitized, sensor-laden, information-driven world. While opportunities exist with
    Big Data, the data can overwhelm traditional technical approaches and the growth
    of data is outpacing scientific and technological advances in data analytics.
    To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
    worked to develop consensus on important fundamental concepts related to Big Data.
    The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework series
    of volumes. This volume, Volume 3, contains the original 51 Version 1 use cases
    gathered by the NBD-PWG Use Cases and Requirements Subgroup and the requirements
    generated from those use cases. The use cases are presented in their original
    and summarized form. Requirements, or challenges, were extracted from each use
    case, and then summarized over all the use cases. These generalized requirements
    were used in the development of the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA),
    which is presented in Volume 6. During the development of Version 2 of the NBDIF,
    the Use Cases and Requirements Subgroup and the Security and Privacy Subgroup
    identified the need for additional use cases to strengthen work of the NBD-PWG
    in Stage 3. The subgroup accepted additional use case submissions using the more
    detailed Use Case Template 2. The three additional use case submissions collected
    using Use Case Template 2 are presented and summarized in this volume.
