abstract:
- content: A series of measurements were made to characterize the global properties
    of moderate-sized pool fires steadily burning in a quiescent environment. A wide
    range of parameters were considered including lightly and heavily sooting hydrocarbon
    fuels (methane, propane and acetylene), burners varying from 0.1 m to 1.0 m in
    diameter, and total heat release rates from about 0.4 kW to 200 kW. These conditions
    yielded flames that were 0.1 m to 2 m in mean height. Measurements were made characterizing
    the time-averaged mass burning rate and the distributions of radiative heat flux
    emitted. The data allowed determination of the fraction of the enthalpy released
    as radiation, a key global parameter characterizing a fire. The heat feedback
    to the fuel surface was modeled and compared to measurements. Hundreds of measurements
    were made in scores of experiments, which were distilled into a handful of time-averaged
    quantities per experiment.
