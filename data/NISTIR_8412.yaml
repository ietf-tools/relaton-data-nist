abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a
    black-box study in conjunction with a scientific foundation review documented
    in NISTIR 8354 Digital Investigation Techniques: A NIST Scientific Foundation
    Review (initially released as a draft report for public comments) [1]. The purpose
    of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of mobile and hard-drive forensic results
    achieved on mock examinations based on the demographic characteristics of the
    participants. The demographic data related to an individual''s workplace environment,
    education, and work experience. This study was open to anyone in the public or
    private sectors who work in the field of digital forensics. This document describes
    the methodology used in the study and a summary of the results.'
