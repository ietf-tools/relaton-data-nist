abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM ) 3289 Multivitamin Tablets was developed
    as part of a collaborative effort between the National Institute for Standards
    and Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary
    Supplements (NIH ODS) as a partial replacement for SRM 3280 Multivitamin/Multielement
    Tablets. SRM 3289 was formulated with both vitamins and elements to replicate
    all analytical challenges associated with the measurement of vitamins in dietary
    supplement matrices. The material was purchased pre-packaged from Gemini Pharmaceuticals
    (Commack, NY), an experienced contract manufacturer. Certified values for fat-soluble
    and water-soluble vitamin-related measurands have been assigned based upon data
    obtained from NIST, manufacturer, and interlaboratory comparison measurements.
    A description of the material, sample preparations, results, and data analysis
    are discussed in the following report.
