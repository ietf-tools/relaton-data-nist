abstract:
- content: This report presents an approach to verifying executability of system behavior
    models by treating them as logical constraint problems solved using Alloy Analyzer,
    a non-proprietary software tool supporting a textual language for logical constraints
    and underlying solvers. With behavior models interpreted as constraints on execution
    order, Alloy can determine whether the models are executable by attempting to
    find executions that meet those constraints. The approach relies on a logical
    interpretation of behavior modeling in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) by
    Ontological Behavior Modeling method that unifies SysML behavior modeling based
    on its classification elements. This paper proposes translation between logical
    versions of SysML behavioral models and logical constructs in Alloy. Finally,
    the approach is demonstrated by translating and solving example SysML behavior
    models.
