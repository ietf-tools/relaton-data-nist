abstract:
- content: Dynamic price signals may provide a way to support integration of customer
    distributed energy resources (DER) into the electric grid and to help manage DER
    flexibility to support distribution system and bulk grid needs. Use of DER flexibility
    includes peak shifting in response to forward market prices, real-time regulation
    in response to 5-minute prices, and, potentially, voltage regulation in response
    to distribution nodal prices. The work presented here compares two approaches
    for managing heat pump cooling to provide grid services. The first approach implements
    a rule-based real-time controller that manages power consumption based on 5-minute
    real-time prices. The second controller uses a building model-based approach to
    optimize load based on day-ahead hourly prices. These approaches are evaluated
    in GridLAB-D simulations. Simulation results show both controllers adjusting temperature
    setpoints in response to price movement, reducing customer cost while staying
    within pre-defined comfort boundaries. These temperature adjustments resulted
    in significant power flow volatility at the substation. The average power flow
    change for the real-time controller, time step to time step, was approximately
    10 % of the peak load. Some observed power flow changes were equivalent to simultaneously
    turning off or on all price-responsive loads on the grid. This power flow volatility
    resulted in voltage volatility at customer meters and greatly increased voltage
    regulator and capacitor bank actions. Analysis suggests that power flow volatility
    may be expected when many devices are price-responsive and controllers have the
    goal of reducing cost without considering voltage. Care must be taken to reduce
    the volatility of the price signal and boost hosting capacity to support synchronized
    price response by a large percentage of load.
