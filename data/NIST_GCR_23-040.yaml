abstract:
- content: Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an application of neural networks that allows
    one to create an image that has the content of one image and the style of another
    image. For example, NST can be used to create an image of a cat in the style of
    Van Gogh’s \emph{Starry Night}. This study asks two distinct questions. Can we
    use NST to manufacture pseudo crime scene images of shoe impressions by transferring
    the style of a crime scene image to a clean impression of a shoe? The idea is
    that the known, clean image will be transformed to take on the characteristics
    of a crime scene image, thereby providing a mechanism for researchers to generate
    pseudo crime scene images that can be used, for example, in training impression
    recognition algorithms. This is useful because there is a shortage of ground truth
    known crime scene-like data. We report that our NST procedure does not produce
    extremely convincing pseudo impressions but the results are nonetheless promising.
    The second question asks if we can improve crime scene/suspect shoe impression
    comparison by using NST as a preprocessing, sharpening step. The idea is that
    the “style” of well-defined edges of the clean impressions will be transferred
    to the crime scene image. We have a lineup of clean shoe impressions containing
    the impression of the shoe that created the crime scene image and several other
    impressions of shoes of the same make, model, and size. We compare the crime scene
    image to each of the shoes in the lineup using an algorithm that computes similarity
    scores. The matching shoe should give the highest score with high probability.
    Next, we combine the crime scene image with an aggregate image of all the clean
    shoe impressions in the lineup using NST. Then we repeat the comparison process
    with the NST image instead of the original crime scene image. We observe that,
    in half of the cases we studied, when we compare the NST image to each of the
    shoes in the lineup, we can more readily distinguish between the matching shoe
    and the non-matching shoes than when we do the comparisons with the original crime
    scene image.
