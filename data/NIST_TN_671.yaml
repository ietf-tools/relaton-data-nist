abstract:
- content: 'In recent years, planar near-field antenna measurements have been developed
    and used in a number of applications. One of the primary concerns with this, or
    any, measurement approach is the accuracy of the results; that is, how do errors
    in measured near field quantities affect the accuracies of far-field parameters
    such as gain, sidelobe levels, monopulse difference level, beam width, etc. Some
    efforts have been made in the past to estimate these errors, but the results have
    been limited in generality and primarily of a qualitative nature. A two-fold approach
    is used in this study to obtain equations giving reasonable upper-bound errors
    resulting from systematic errors in the near-field measurements. The strategy
    has been to derive error expressions from the equations relating near and far
    field quantities and also to computer simulate errors using actual measured near-field
    data. The simulation has both given some direction to, and confirmed the results
    of the analysis. The errors which have been investigated are: x, y, and z-position
    errors of the probe, amplitude and phase uncertainties of the measured data, and
    multiple reflections between the probe and test antenna. The results not only
    give the effects of errors in a given quantity, but also specify the form of the
    error (i.e., linear, quadratic, periodic, etc.) which will produce the largest
    effect in the far-field parameters. This information is very valuable in designing
    the measuring equipment so that these types of errors can be avoided, or minimized.'
