abstract:
- content: NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-57 provides cryptographic key management
    guidance. It consists of three parts. Part 1 provides general guidance and best
    practices for the management of cryptographic keying material. Part 2 provides
    guidance on policy and security planning requirements. Finally, Part 3 provides
    guidance when using the cryptographic features of current systems. Part 2 (this
    document) 1) identifies the concepts, functions and elements common to effective
    systems for the management of symmetric and asymmetric keys; 2) identifies the
    security planning requirements and documentation necessary for effective institutional
    key management; 3) describes Key Management Specification requirements; 4) describes
    cryptographic Key Management Policy documentation that is needed by organizations
    that use cryptography; and 5) describes Key Management Practice Statement requirements.
    Appendices provide examples of some key management infrastructures and supplemental
    documentation and planning materials.
