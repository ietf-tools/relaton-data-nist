abstract:
- content: In this paper, we expand previous analytical models to offer a more complete
    representation of Model B ProSe direct discovery. Using these models, we can obtain
    performance metrics such as the average time a given Remote User Equipment (UE)
    takes to discover a Relay UE, and we can examine the sensitivity of the relay
    performance to various input parameters such as the number of Remote UEs, the
    number of Relay UEs, and the Discovery message transmission rate. We use ns- 3
    system level simulations to validate our analytical model and determine the optimal
    strategy for UEs to use in various deployment scenarios.
