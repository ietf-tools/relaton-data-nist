abstract:
- content: This publication is written for those participating in the retroreflectance
    measurement assurance program (MAP) service provided by the National Bureau of
    Standards. This service is to verify the accuracy of measurement of coefficient
    of luminous intensity (R). This paper presents the techniques and procedures that
    are pertinent to participating in the MAP service, as well as a detailed explanation
    of the error analyses. Uncertainties for both retroreflectance and luminous transmittance
    were determined from two pilot studies carried out with the assistance of two
    industrial laboratories and by research performed on the elements of the MAP package.
