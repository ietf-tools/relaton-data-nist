abstract:
- content: The purpose of Special Publication 800-128, Guide for Security-Focused
    Configuration Management of Information Systems, is to provide guidelines for
    organizations responsible for managing and administering the security of federal
    information systems and associated environments of operation. Configuration management
    concepts and principles described in NIST SP 800-128, provide supporting information
    for NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
    and Organizations. NIST SP 800-128 assumes that information security is an integral
    part of an organization⁰₉s overall configuration management. The focus of this
    document is on implementation of the information system security aspects of configuration
    management, and as such the term security-focused configuration management (SecCM)
    is used to emphasize the concentration on information security. In addition to
    the fundamental concepts associated with SecCM, the process of applying SecCM
    practices to information systems is described. The goal of SecCM activities is
    to manage and monitor the configurations of information systems to achieve adequate
    security and minimize organizational risk while supporting the desired business
    functionality and services.
