abstract:
- content: 'This report summarizes the findings of the NIST Scientific Integrity Program
    assessment of the program for the period between 1 January 2020 and 31 May 2022.
    It provides an assessment of the current state of the program in advance of planned
    updates in 2022. The evaluation was initiated in response to a recommendation
    from a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, Scientific Integrity
    Policies: Additional Actions Could Strengthen Integrity of Federal Research, April
    2019. In addition, the report serves as a baseline evaluation before implementation
    of substantial updates to the program related to the Presidential Memorandum on
    Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific Integrity and Evidence-Based
    Policy Making, January 27, 2021.'
