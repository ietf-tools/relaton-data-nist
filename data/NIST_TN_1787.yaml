abstract:
- content: 'This report summarizes research results to date under the FY2012 interagency
    agreement between CPSC and NIST to develop testing and measurement protocols for
    determining the quantities and properties of nanoparticles released from flooring
    finishes and interior paints. This report includes: 1) a critical assessment of
    products, 2) literature review of nanoparticle release from nanocomposite coatings
    and paints by mechanical forces, 3) surface morphology characterization of nano-filled
    flooring coatings and interior paints before abrasion, 4) materials and experiment
    to evaluate the use of a Taber abraser for generating particles from flooring
    coatings and interior paints, 5) experimental protocols for abrasion test and
    analyses of release particles and abraded surfaces, 6) concentration, size distribution
    and chemical composition data for release nanoparticles accumulated on nano-filled
    coating and paint surfaces under different abrading conditions and wheel type,
    and 7) preliminary data on chemical composition of abraded nano-filled flooring
    coating and interior paint surfaces.'
