abstract:
- content: 'Data collected from the Intelligent Building Agents Laboratory (IBAL)
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are used to develop
    a physics-based and four machine learning models of ice-on-coil thermal energy
    storage (TES): linear interpolation, linear regression, neural network, and Gaussian
    process. Data cleaning considerations are discussed in addition to presenting
    the results of the five models. For this TES system, which is linear over a significant
    range of operation, the linear interpolation model performs the best, but there
    is a thorough discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each model.'
