abstract:
- content: These guidelines describe the important considerations for planning, conducting,
    analyzing, and disseminating the results of a Home Performance Contactor (HPC)
    round robin study of a specific aspect of the HPC industry services. The round
    robin study focuses on gathering information needed to provide a better understanding
    of the variability in any number of performance characteristics of interest to
    a particular sector of the HPC industry. For example, a round robin can be used
    to estimate variability in the estimated energy performance of a given home, the
    necessary sizing of particular equipment, the potential savings from retrofit
    options, or a ranked list of cost-effective retrofit measures. Ultimately, it
    is anticipated that such activities will help developers of best practices, guidelines,
    and standards to improve those products to provide a more reliable prediction
    for the homeowner and to elicit confidence in those who will pay for enhanced
    building performance or measures to attain that performance.
