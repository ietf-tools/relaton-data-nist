abstract:
- content: Password entry on mobile devices significantly impacts both usability and
    security, but there is a lack of usable security research in this area, specifically
    for complex password entry. To address this research gap, we set out to assign
    strength metrics to passwords for which we already had usability data, in an effort
    to have a more meaningful comparison between usability and security. This document
    reports a method of optimizing the input of randomly generated passwords on mobile
    devices via password permutation to allow for a comparison of password usability
    data. We found that the number of keystrokes saved the efficiency gained via permutation
    depends on the number of onscreen keyboard changes required in the original password
    rather than on password length. Additionally, we created and are releasing Python
    scripts (publicly available from https://github.com/usnistgov/PasswordMetrics)
    for the experiments on entropy loss we conducted across passwords ranging in length
    from 5 to 20 characters.
