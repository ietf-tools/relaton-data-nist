abstract:
- content: This paper describes an effort to validate the applicability of cybersecurity
    controls from the 2014 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Interagency
    Report 7628 Revision 1 (NISTIR 7628 r1) Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity
    to High DER (Distributed Energy Resources) environments. The paper summarizes
    insights gained through stakeholder interviews and workshops, and provides updates
    to current cybersecurity guidance and recommendations for future research.
