abstract:
- content: This document introduces the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), explains its
    importance to the internet, and provides a set of best practices that can help
    in protecting BGP. Best practices described here are intended to be implementable
    on nearly all currently available BGP routers. While a number of enhanced protocols
    for BGP have been proposed, these generally require substantial changes to the
    protocol and may not interoperate with current BGP implementations. To improve
    the security of BGP routers, the recommendations listed below are introduced.
    While the recommendations can contribute to greatly improved BGP security, they
    are not a complete defense against all threats. Security administrators and decision
    makers should select and apply these methods based on their unique needs.
