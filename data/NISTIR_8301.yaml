abstract:
- content: 'Blockchain technology has enabled a new software paradigm for managing
    digital ownership in partial- or zero-trust environments. It uses tokens to conduct
    transactions, exchange verifiable data, and achieve coordination across organizations
    and on the web. Fundamental to this representation is that users can independently
    control token custody in digital wallets through public-key cryptography and interact
    with one another in a peer-to-peer manner. Blockchain networks provide secure
    transaction reconciliation, linkage, and storage in consolidated, integrity-protected
    distributed ledgers forming mutually operated record-keeping execution environments.
    Data models with varied capabilities and scopes have been defined to issue tokens,
    which additional protocols can help manage while enabling separation of concerns.
    Security and recovery mechanisms allow users to set up self-hosted, externally
    hosted, and hybrid account custody models. Scaling schemes have been developed
    to accommodate transactions off-chain with deferred on-chain settlement, as well
    as deposit contracts with built-in, self-enforceable conditions to exchange tokens
    without intermediaries, transaction submission rules to fit in with different
    deployment scenarios, and privacy-enhancing techniques to protect user confidentiality.
    Software design patterns and infrastructure tools can also make it easier to integrate
    blockchain networks, wallets, and external resources in user interfaces. This
    document provides a high-level technical overview and conceptual framework of
    token designs and management methods. It is built around five views: the token
    view, wallet view, transaction view, user interface view, and protocol view. The
    purpose is to lower the barriers to study, prototype, and integrate token-related
    standards and protocols by helping readers understand the building blocks involved
    both on-chain and off-chain.'
