abstract:
- content: An investigation on the impact toughness properties of wrought and additively-manufactured
    (AM) Ti-6Al-4V was conducted at NIST Boulder, by means of instrumented impact
    tests on miniaturized Charpy specimens. Full transition curves for absorbed energy
    and lateral expansion were obtained by performing tests in the temperature range
    between -196 C and 700 C. The effect of various parameters was investigated for
    AM specimens, namely specimen orientation, Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPping), and
    notch configuration (printed or machined). Our results indicate that AM specimens
    exhibit equivalent or better impact toughness than wrought material after HIPping,
    and that the material is more resistant to cracks growing in the plane perpendicular
    to the build direction than in the plane containing the build direction. HIPping
    has a significantly beneficial effect for the AM material, while no effect of
    notch configuration was observed from the results obtained. Characteristic instrumented
    forces allow a qualitative assessment of dynamic tensile properties, which appear
    to be similar for wrought and AM Ti-6Al-4V.
