abstract:
- content: 'The CCQM_Retrospectoscope system combines a database of results from Consultative
    Committee for the Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology (CCQM)
    studies with a number of graphical tools for trying to make sense of the data.
    This system supports fairly comprehensive and potentially novel appraisals of
    participation and measurement performance throughout the history of the CCQM activities.
    The appraisals include the bias, uncertainty, and degrees of equivalence of results
    submitted by individual national metrology or designated institutes (NMI|DIs);
    the relative performance of NMI|DIs, and the uncertainty function characteristic
    of entire Working Groups (WGs). This “Quick Start” guide is intended to introduce
    potential users to the system and help them get started using it.'
