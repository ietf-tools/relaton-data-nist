abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinated an interlaboratory
    study for laboratories that use photoacoustic spectroscopy to measure and report
    aerosol absorption. This report describes the design and results for the NIST
    Interlaboratory Study of Aerosol Absorption Measurements using Photoacoustic Spectroscopy
    from twelve participating laboratories using a material that was characterized
    and distributed by NIST on June 12, 2017. Participants were requested to provide
    measurement results by August 30, 2017. The participating laboratories reported
    4,569 aerosol absorption cross sections as a function of particle size, particle
    mass and wavelength.
