abstract:
- content: The document provides both an overview and technical details of test scenarios
    that are designed by our group. Those test scenarios can be used to verify the
    protocol implementation of the off- network mode of 3GPP defined mission critical
    push-to-talk (MCPTT) operations, covering floor control, call control, and call
    type control. This release contains test cases for basic group calls, private
    calls and broadcast group calls. A test scenario is presented in a table format,
    and sometimes a figure for the messages exchanged over the air as well.
