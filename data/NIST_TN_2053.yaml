abstract:
- content: The purpose of this document is to provide instructions for using a newly
    developed TRNSYS component (Type277). Type277 utilizes socket communication to
    provide loosely-coupled integration between TRNSYS and Java-based components.
    Bi-directional flow of information is facilitated using the client-server architecture
    of Java. Type277 is compiled as both a 32-bit and 64-bit dynamic link library
    to support co-simulation with TRNSYS17 and TRNSYS18 projects. An application of
    Type277 is demonstrated by modifying an example TRNSYS project. The Java project
    and files, TRNSYS modified example projects, and Type277 dynamic link libraries
    are being made available to the public through the NIST GitHub site.
