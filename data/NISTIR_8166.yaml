abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in collaboration
    with ECRI conducted a study titled Examining the Copy and Paste Function in the
    Use of Electronic Health Records which was intended to help fill the gap in understanding
    the implications of the copy and paste functionality by providing a more in-depth
    examination of how practitioners utilize the copy and paste function in EHRs,
    exploring if and when they use, what they think about and the ways in which it
    may or may not lead to errors that could affect patient safety and finally, substantiating
    the ECRI Partnership recommendations for the safe use of copy and paste function
    in health IT by providing human factors based recommendations for the safe use
    of the copy and paste function based on the study findings and collegial discussions
    with clinical experts. Major findings resulting from a Human Factors assessment
    derived from empirical data obtained from this study of the copy and paste function
    are identified as follows: Length of information: Unconstrained ability to extract
    a large amount of information using copy and paste can present users with convoluted
    and/or irrelevant information impairing situation awareness. Users may miss important
    pieces of information. Attribution of information: Clinicians need to know the
    source of the copied and pasted information, who copied and pasted it, what was
    added to/edited in the information and the date and time the information was copied
    and pasted. Wrong information: A common error in the use of copy and paste is
    that users forget to properly review and edit all of the information they have
    copied and pasted (frequent interruptions in the clinical environment being one
    of the major causes of this error) and users are not provided with system features
    that promote efficient editing. This report provides specific recommendations
    for user interface design to ensure safety-related usability for the copy and
    paste function.'
