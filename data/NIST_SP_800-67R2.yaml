abstract:
- content: This publication specifies the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA),
    including its primary component cryptographic engine, the Data Encryption Algorithm
    (DEA). TDEA is intended to be used with a Special Publication (SP) 800-38-series-compliant
    mode of operation in a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2-compliant
    cryptographic module, TDEA may be used by federal organizations to protect sensitive
    unclassified data. Protection of data during transmission or while in storage
    may be necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information
    represented by the data. This Recommendation defines the mathematical steps required
    to cryptographically protect data using TDEA and to subsequently process such
    protected data. TDEA is made available for use by federal agencies within the
    context of a total security program consisting of physical security procedures,
    good information management practices, and computer system/network access controls.
