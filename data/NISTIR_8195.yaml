abstract:
- content: Spectrum monitoring serves as the eyes and ears of the spectrum management
    process and helps spectrum managers to plan and use frequencies, avoid incompatible
    usage, and identify sources of harmful interference. The key objective for this
    research at NIST is to develop a prototype for spectral analysis of both licensed
    and unlicensed radio frequency (RF) bands, allowing the monitoring of the industrial
    environment and the access of that information in a simple way for use at industrial
    facilities with noisy environments and real-time performance requirements, including
    factories, warehouse and discrete manufacturing, assembly, robotics, oil and gas
    refineries, water and wastewater treatment plants. This paper provides the specification
    of industry requirements of spectrum monitoring systems in industrial facilities,
    so that NIST research will meet these needs.
