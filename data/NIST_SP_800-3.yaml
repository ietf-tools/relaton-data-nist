abstract:
- content: Government agencies and other organizations have begun to augment their
    computer security efforts because of increased threats to computer security. Incidents
    involving these threats, including computer viruses, malicious user activity,
    and vulnerabilities associated with high technology, require a skilled and rapid
    response before they can cause significant damage. These increased computer security
    efforts, described here as Computer Security Incident Response Capabilities (CSIRCs),
    have as a primary focus the goal of reacting quickly and efficiently to computer
    security incidents. CSIRC efforts provide agencies with a centralized and cost-effective
    approach to handling computer security incidents so that future problems can be
    efficiently resolved and prevented.
