abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 150-17, NVLAP Cryptographic and Security Testing, presents
    the technical requirements and guidance for the accreditation of laboratories
    under the NVLAP Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) program. It is intended
    for information and use by accredited laboratories, laboratories seeking accreditation,
    laboratory accreditation systems, users of laboratory services, and others needing
    information on the requirements for accreditation under this program. The 2013
    edition incorporates the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) version 1.2
    requirements for testing. Amendments have been made to Annex E, SCAP testing,
    and the SCAP-related portions of the body text; the rest of the handbook is unchanged
    from the 2012 edition. The requirements of NIST Handbook 150, the interpretations
    and specific requirements in NIST Handbook 150-17 must be combined to produce
    the criteria for accreditation in the NVLAP CST program. For more information,
    visit the NVLAP website, http://www.nist.gov/nvlap.
