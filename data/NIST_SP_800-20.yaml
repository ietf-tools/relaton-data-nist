abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Modes of Operation
    Validation System for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TMOVS) specifies the
    procedures involved in validating implementations of the Triple DES algorithm
    in ANSI X9.52 - 1998, Triple Data Encryption Algorithm Modes of Operation. Successful
    completion of the tests contained within the TMOVS is required to claim conformance
    to ANSI X9.52-1998.The TMOVS is designed to perform automated testing on Implementations
    Under Test (IUTs). This publication provides a brief overview of the Triple DES
    algorithm and introduces the basic design and configuration of the TMOVS. Included
    in this overview are the specifications for the two categories of tests which
    make up the TMOVS, i.e., the Known Answer tests and the Modes tests. The requirements
    and administrative procedures to be followed by those seeking formal NIST validation
    of an implementation of the Triple DES algorithm are presented. The requirements
    described include the specific protocols for communication between the IUT and
    the TMOVS, the types of tests which the IUT must pass for format NIST validation,
    and general instruction for accessing and interfacing the TMOVS. An appendix with
    tables of values and results for the TDES Known Answer tests is also provided.
