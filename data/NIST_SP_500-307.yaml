abstract:
- content: With cloud computing in the mainstream, there is a preponderance of cloud
    based services in the market and the choices for consumers increase daily. However,
    comparing the service offerings between cloud service providers is not a straightforward
    exercise. As part of the decision-making framework for moving to the cloud, having
    data on measurable capabilities, for example - quality of service, availability
    and reliability, give the cloud service customer the tools and opportunity to
    make informed choices and to gain an understanding of the service being delivered.
    A metric provides knowledge about characteristics of a cloud property through
    both its definition (e.g. expression, unit, rules) and the values resulting from
    the measurement of the property. This document proposes concepts and a model to
    represent cloud service metrics. This model represents the information needed
    to understand a targeted cloud property and which constraints should be applied
    during measurement
