abstract:
- content: Application container technologies, also known as containers, are a form
    of operating system virtualization combined with application software packaging.
    Containers provide a portable, reusable, and automatable way to package and run
    applications. This publication explains the potential security concerns associated
    with the use of containers and provides recommendations for addressing these concerns.
