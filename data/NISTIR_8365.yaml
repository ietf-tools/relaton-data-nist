abstract:
- content: We propose a new testbed for assessing the performance of wireless techniques
    in support of industrial operations. We developed a collaborative robot work-cell
    manufacturing scenario as the emulated cyber-physical system (CPS) model. Specifically,
    data flows between networked work-cell components, e.g., programmable logic controllers
    (PLC), robotic arms, and machining tools, were identified by specific industrial
    communication protocols; network connections were also defined for both Ethernet-based
    wired links and alternative wireless interfaces. A measurement framework was introduced
    to collect various system events from both work-cell operations and network traffics;
    a distributed clock synchronization scheme was developed to ensure the consistency
    of measurement record timing at different sources. To facilitate offline performance
    analysis and data exploration, a new data pipeline was adopted that uses the graph
    database (GDB) for testbed data management. The developed testbed has been in
    use in evaluating industrial wireless performance by the NIST team and industrial
    partners.
