abstract:
- content: The Smart Grid Profile is an initial attempt to apply risk management strategies
    from the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity
    Framework) to the smart grid. The Profile provides cybersecurity risk management
    guidance to power system owners/operators by prioritizing cybersecurity activities
    based on their effectiveness in helping power system owners/operators achieve
    common high-level business objectives for the smart grid. The Profile also provides
    a list of considerations relevant to the challenges power system owners/operators
    may experience as they implement these cybersecurity activities in infrastructures
    with high concentrations of distributed energy resources (DERs).
