abstract:
- content: 'Executive Order (EO) 13717: Establishing a Federal Earthquake Risk Management
    Standard establishes minimum seismic requirements for new and existing buildings
    that will be constructed, altered, leased, financed, or regulated by the Federal
    Government. These requirements help to enhance the seismic resilience of agencies
    by reducing risk to lives of building occupants and improving the probability
    of continued performance of buildings essential to agency mission following future
    earthquakes. The EO rescinds EO 12941: Seismic Safety of Existing Federally Owned
    or Leased Buildings and EO 12699: Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted
    or Regulated New Building Construction. The EO requires that agencies whose activities
    are covered by the order submit a biennial report to the Director of the Office
    of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) on their progress in implementing the order, commencing
    two years from the date of the order. It is assumed that agencies that are covered
    by the EO participate on the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction
    (ICSSC). NIST, as the lead agency of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
    Program (NEHRP) and thus Secretariat of the ICSSC, is required by the EO to summarize
    agency compliance of the order in the biennial NEHRP report to Congress. This
    report serves as the summary of agency progress in implementing the EO and covers
    the biennial reporting period of February 2, 2018 to February 1, 2020. Sixteen
    reports covering sixty-six agencies (department, agency, bureau, office, institute,
    etc.) were received by NIST for this reporting period.'
