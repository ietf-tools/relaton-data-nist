abstract:
- content: 'With the continuing frequency, intensity, and adverse consequences of
    cyber-attacks, disruptions, hazards, and other threats to federal, state, and
    local governments, the military, businesses, and the critical infrastructure,
    the need for trustworthy secure systems has never been more important to the long-
    term economic and national security interests of the United States. Engineering-based
    solutions are essential to managing the growing complexity, dynamicity, and interconnectedness
    of today''s systems, as exemplified by cyber-physical systems and systems-of-systems,
    including the Internet of Things. This publication addresses the engineering-driven
    perspective and actions necessary to develop more defensible and survivable systems,
    inclusive of the machine, physical, and human components that compose the systems
    and the capabilities and services delivered by those systems. It starts with and
    builds upon a set of well-established International Standards for systems and
    software engineering published by the International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute
    of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and infuses systems security engineering
    methods, practices, and techniques into those systems and software engineering
    activities. The objective is to address security issues from a stakeholder protection
    needs, concerns, and requirements perspective and to use established engineering
    processes to ensure that such needs, concerns, and requirements are addressed
    with appropriate fidelity and rigor, early and in a sustainable manner throughout
    the life cycle of the system. [Supersedes SP 800-160 (January 2018): https://www.nist.gov/publications/systems-security-
