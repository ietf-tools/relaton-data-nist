abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has produced
    Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products: Guidance for Checklist
    Users and Developers to facilitate the development and dissemination of security
    configuration checklists so that organizations and individual users can better
    secure their IT products. A security configuration checklist (sometimes called
    a lockdown or hardening guide or benchmark) is in its simplest form a series of
    instructions for configuring a product to a particular security level (or baseline).
    It could also include templates or automated scripts and other procedures. Typically,
    checklists are created by IT vendors for their own products; however, checklists
    are also created by other organizations such as consortia, academia, and government
    agencies. The use of well-written, standardized checklists can markedly reduce
    the vulnerability exposure of IT products. Checklists may be particularly helpful
    to small organizations and individuals that have limited resources for securing
    their systems. This publication is intended for users and developers of IT product
    security configuration checklists. For checklist users, this document gives an
    overview of the NIST Checklist Program, explains how to retrieve checklists from
    NIST''s repository, and provides general information about threat discussions
    and baseline technical security practices for associated operational environments.
    For checklist developers, the document sets forth the policies, procedures, and
    general requirements for participation in the NIST Checklist Program.'
