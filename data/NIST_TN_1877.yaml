abstract:
- content: e combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with X-ray microanalysis
    and image processing provides a powerful ability to image and quantify microstructural
    features of construction materials. is document provides guidance for collecting
    backsca ered electron images and X-ray element maps of polished sections of Portland
    cement clinker. It furnishes step-by-step procedures for processing image data
    to produce segmentation of an image eld into its constituent mineral phases, and
    describes ways use the segmented image to measure the abundance, surface area,
    and spatial distribution of phases in the image eld. Inherent heterogeneity of
    the microstructure implies that di erent image elds of the same material will
    contain di erent phase abundances; the document suggests ways to estimate and
    compensate for the heterogeneity length scale through statistical analysis of
    multiple image elds. and analysis using a scanning electron microscope will be
    illustrated using an example from the development of Standard Reference Materials
    for portland cement clinker.
