abstract:
- content: 'A series of field experiments was conducted to examine the effects on
    fire spread toward a structure for combustible fences and mulch under conditions
    that may be encountered in a wildland-urban interface (WUI) fire. The fire behavior
    of a variety of materials, designs, and configurations were studied under various
    wind conditions. The 187 experiments were split into five categories: mulch only,
    fence only, fence plus mulch, parallel fences, and long range firebrand experiments.
    Fence materials included western redcedar, California redwood, pine, vinyl, and
    wood-plastic composites, and fence styles included privacy, lattice, and good
    neighbor (board on board). The tested mulch types were shredded hardwood, mini
    pine bark nuggets, pine straw, rubber, and artificial turf. A wind machine provided
    a mean wind speed between 6 m/s and 14 m/s (13 mi/h to 31 mi/h). The fence and/or
    mulch bed was ignited by a propane burner on the ground at the end farthest from
    the structure. A small structure was located between 0 m and 1.83 m (0 ft to 6
    ft) downwind of the fence or mulch bed as a target for flames and firebrands.
    A target mulch bed at the base of the structure tested the ability of firebrands
    produced by the burning fence and mulch bed to ignite spot fires that threatened
    the structure.'
