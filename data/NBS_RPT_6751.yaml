abstract:
- content: During 1959 and I960 long-term transmission loss measurements were performed
    over a 223 kilometer path in Eastern Colorado using frequencies of 100 and 751
    Mc. This path intersects Pikes Peak which forms a knife-edge type obstacle visible
    from both terminals. The transmission loss measurements have been analyzed in
    terms of diurnal and seasonal variations in hourly medians and in instantaneous
    levels. As expected, results show that the long-term fading range is substantially
    less than expected for tropospheric scatter paths of comparable length. Transmission
    loss levels were in general agreement with predicted knife-edge diffraction propagation
    when allowance is made for rounding of the knife edge. A technique for estimating
    long-term fading ranges is presented and the results are in good agreement with
    observations. Short-term variations in some cases resemble the space-wave fadeouts
    commonly observed on within-the-horizon paths, although other phenomena may contribute
    to the fading. Since the foreground terrain was rough, there was no evidence of
    direct and ground-reflected lobe structure. In most cases comparatively high correlation
    exists between signals received simultaneously on two antennas with 8.3 and 14
    meters vertical separation. These separations were chosen as being representative
    for practical space diversity systems designed for eliminating the effects of
    fading arising from direct and ground reflected phase interference phenomena.
    The comparatively high correlation observed suggests that space diversity will
    be relatively less successful in mountain obstacle paths with rough terrain near
    the terminals than on tropospheric scatter paths or on line-of-sight paths over
    smooth terrain. The enhancement of field strength associated with propagation
    over mountain ridges may cause concern in applications where mountains are being
    counted on to shield unwanted radio waves. Some radio astronomy installations
    have been located in mountain valleys for this reason, and it is possible that
    obstacle-gain effects may aggravate rather than alleviate interference.
