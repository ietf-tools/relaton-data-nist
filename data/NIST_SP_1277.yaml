abstract:
- content: Modern building codes and standards are generally focused on safeguarding
    public health and safety by ensuring buildings meet life safety performance objectives
    following an earthquake event. Certain classes of buildings, such as hospitals
    and schools, may be designed to a higher standard to minimize disruption. As communities
    target resilience of their built environment, it is becoming evident that life
    safety performance can nevertheless result in massive disruptions for large classes
    of residential and commercial buildings. It is possible to design buildings to
    provide more rapid restoration of reoccupancy and functionality than life safety
    standards. Recovery-based design is intended to support a community's post-earthquake
    resilience and represents an advancement in design practice. This report presents
    a framework to provide guidance on the economic benefits and costs of adopting
    functional recovery in design practice. A unique aspect of the framework is the
    acknowledgement that benefits from recovery-based design are distributed across
    various community stakeholders (e.g., residents, customers, local government),
    in addition to stakeholders at the building level (e.g., owners and tenants).
    Thus, the framework carefully details the attribution of impacts to the range
    of stakeholders potentially affected by improved building-design criteria. A key
    objective of the framework is to identify the set of potential benefits and costs,
    impacted stakeholders, and available data and tools for quantification. In the
    process, we identify gaps in measurement science for conducting a complete benefit-cost
    analysis. In addition, we provide a brief case study example that illustrates
    application of the framework.
