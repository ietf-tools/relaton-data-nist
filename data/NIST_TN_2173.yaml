abstract:
- content: This report outlines NIST s validation tools, developed to help address
    the smart grid semergent needs and complement research and standards coordination
    efforts. Rapid ad-vances have enabled an opportunity for the grid to autonomously
    and simultaneously con-trol generation, balance load, and regulate power quality.
    The grid will need this coordi-nated control to regulate power voltage, in real-
    time, to meet fast-changing power demands,especially with increasing distributed
    energy resources. To do this, the grid needs mea- surements from across the distribution
    network to accurately assess demand and preventnegative impacts. It also needs
    improved situational awareness, which Advanced MeteringInfrastructure (AMI) and
    other technologies can enable. Moreover, lessons from AMI usecan aid research
    and development of a coordinated control system. Additionally, such acoordinated
    control system depends a new operating paradigm with new two-way infor-mation
    flows between aspects of the grid, or domains. NIST offers such a paradigm in
    itsSmart Grid Framework 4.0.In going forward, industry has concerns which must
    be addressed. Distribution systemoperators (DSO) need centralized functions to
    coordinate distributed assets. To imple-ment such centralization, DSOs need an
    understanding of bandwidth, security and integrityconsiderations, while also ensuring
    performances at the grid s edges. Industry is also con-cerned with how to represent
    uncertainties in a complex cyber-physical system, like latencyand cyber- vulnerabilities.And,
    industry is concerned that standards are focused more on de-vices, than on coordinated
    control systems.
