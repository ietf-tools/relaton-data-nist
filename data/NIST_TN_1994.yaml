abstract:
- content: 'Accurate prediction of aerodynamic pressures on a building is a key factor
    in the estimation of wind loads on the building. Since the analytical approach
    has limited capacity in providing pressure estimates, wind tunnel testing is widely
    used. The experimental approach faces a challenge: pressures on building models
    cannot be directly measured by pressure sensors. Rather, a tubing system connecting
    the model to the sensor is required. The pressure waves propagating inside a thin,
    circular tube distort the aerodynamic pressures on the model owing to the acoustic
    and visco-thermal effects due to the fluid action on the tube, As a result, pressure
    fluctuations measured through a tubing system experience amplitude change and
    phase shift that depend on the pressure fluctuations'' frequencies. It is therefore
    necessary to develop a correction procedure for converting the distorted pressures
    data measured by a transducer into pressures that differ insignificantly from
    the actual aerodynamic pressures on the model. To address this issue, we reviewed
    the Navier-Stokes equations, thermodynamic effects, wave propagation issues, and
    mass and energy conservation associated with sinusoidal air motions in cylindrical
    tubing systems, and developed a MATLAB-based program to calibrate the amplitude
    change and phase lag in tubing configurations used in wind tunnel testing. To
    validate the requisite amplitude ratio and phase lag transfer functions an experimental
    device was designed and built using a function generator and a speaker. In addition,
    the validation accounted for phase changes due to the measuring sequence in a
    multi-channel pressure scanner. The results showed that the transfer functions
    obtained by the numerical approaches match their experimental counterparts to
    a remarkably close approximation. An optimized configuration of typical tubing
    systems was designed for minimization of tubing effects on pressure measurements.'
