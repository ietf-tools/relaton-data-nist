abstract:
- content: 'The first-ever engineering-derived tornado wind speed maps have been produced
    for the contiguous United States. Using multi-variate statistical analysis of
    11 tornado and physiographic variables, we developed 9 broad tornado climatology
    regions. We analyzed regional and national data to produce probabilistic models
    for: population bias; EF-Scale distribution; tornado path length, width, direction,
    and translational speed; radius of maximum winds; tornado path length intensity
    variation; variable path widths within a tornado; mean to maximum path width ratios;
    and maximum damage widths relative to local path width. We used a probabilistic
    load and resistance modeling framework to develop engineering-derived wind speeds
    from the EF-Scale system by analyzing the most common Damage Indicator (FR12,
    one- and two-family residences) used to rate EF3-5 tornadoes. The developed wind
    speed distributions, based on 44 3-D models of FR12 structures, are broad and
    encompass the original judgment-based EF-Scale wind speeds. We used these data
    to support a probabilistic tornado wind field model, simulate tornado wind speed
    swaths, and develop regional tornado hazard curves. The tornado hazard curves
    depend on the building or “target” size. Fifty-one tornado wind speed maps were
    developed for 8 target sizes ranging from geometric points to 4 million sq ft
    targets and for 8 return periods from 300 to 10 million years. Numerous judgments
    and assumptions were required in the model development. Many of the probabilistic
    models consider both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties. The derived mean wind
    speeds are “best-estimates” and are intended for use in engineering design and
    safety analysis.'
