abstract:
- content: 'NIST co-hosted the 2018-2019 GCTC Smart and Secure Cities and Communities
    Challenge (SC3) program with DHS S&T and NTIA. The objective was to encourage
    participating teams to include cybersecurity and privacy as integral project elements
    alongside goals such as replicability, scalability, sustainability, and interoperability
    of technologies and systems. In parallel, GCTC''s Public Safety SuperCluster (PSSC)
    sought to bring together domain experts in public safety to discuss the latest
    issues and developments and to explore designed-in cybersecurity and privacy for
    public safety solutions. This report highlights two significant accomplishments
    of the PSSC: First, this report describes in detail the workshop hosted by PSSC
    and NIST in October 2018 to address the latest progress and plans of the Public
    Safety SuperCluster and, further, to initiate an active collaboration with the
    Cybersecurity and Privacy Advisory Committee (CPAC) to begin incorporating the
    dimension of cybersecurity into the PSSC effort. This section describes presentations
    and group discussions around shared perspectives on the latest developments in
    public safety and cybersecurity for smart cities and communities. The workshop
    provided a foundation for PSSC''s activities in 2019. Secondly, this publication
    includes a summary of the first in a planned series of reports on use cases, technology
    demonstrations, and exercise summaries involving the work and outcomes of PSSC
    Action Clusters and Public Safety-related efforts in GCTC communities. It highlights
    a significant demonstration in November 2019 of a live simulation-based, multi-team
    training exercise in Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) response that was conducted
    by the GCTC research team from the George Mason University in collaboration with
    Fairfax County, Virginia, first responder agencies.'
