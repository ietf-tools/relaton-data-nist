abstract:
- content: Among the many classes of engineered nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles
    (GNPs) are one of the most widely studied and utilized nanoscale platforms for
    biomedical applications including diagnostics, therapeutics, and transfection.
    This is due in part to their general biocompatibility, facile synthesis and unique
    optical properties.3 To realize these achievements, a systematic evaluation of
    GNP stability, particularly under physiologically relevant conditions, is critical
    for the efficacious and safe application of GNPs in any biomedical or technical
    application. A lack of well documented and reproducible protocols motivated the
    development of the present collection of methods, which address stability with
    respect to aging, different media, pH, temperature, chemical resistance, and long-term
    storage.
