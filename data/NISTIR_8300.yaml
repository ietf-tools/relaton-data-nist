abstract:
- content: 'Good registration between the coordinate frames of a perception system
    and a robot is important for the efficient operation of autonomous systems in
    vision-guided assembly lines. Rigid-body registration, which is based on the measurement
    of corresponding points (fiducials) in both frames, is a commonly used method.
    Noise and possible bias in the measured points degrade the quality of registration
    as gauged by the Target Registration Error (TRE). A method to restore the rigid
    body condition (RRBC) was recently developed to reduce TRE when the bias is larger
    than the noise. This was achieved by applying corrections to target locations
    in the vision sensor frame. This paper presents two procedures to improve the
    performance of the RRBC method by: 1) selecting the location of fiducials used
    for calculating correction to the target location and 2) selecting the correct
    arm configuration for fiducial from multiple configurations as calculated by inverse
    kinematics. Experiments performed with a motion tracking system and two different
    robot arms show that these two procedures can further reduce the Root Mean Square
    of TRE (RMST) to less than 20 % of the uncorrected RMST.'
