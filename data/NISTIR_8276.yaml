abstract:
- content: In today's highly connected, inter-dependent world, all organizations rely
    on others for critical products and services. However, the reality of globalization,
    while providing many benefits, has resulted in a world where organizations no
    longer fully control -- and often do not have full visibility into -- the supply
    ecosystems of the products that they make or the services that they deliver. With
    more and more businesses becoming digital, producing digital products and services,
    and moving their workloads to the cloud, the impact of a cybersecurity event today
    is greater than ever before and could include personal data loss, significant
    financial losses, compromise of product integrity or safety, and even loss of
    life. Organizations can no longer protect themselves by simply securing their
    own infrastructures since their electronic perimeter is no longer meaningful;
    threat actors intentionally target the suppliers of more cyber-mature organizations
    to take advantage of the weakest link. That is why identifying, assessing, and
    mitigating cyber supply chain risks is a critical capability to ensure business
    resilience. The multidisciplinary approach to managing these types of risks is
    called Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM). This document provides the
    ever- increasing community of digital businesses a set of Key Practices that any
    organization can use to manage cybersecurity risks associated with their supply
    chains. The Key Practices presented in this document can be used to implement
    a robust C-SCRM function at an organization of any size, scope, and complexity.
    These practices combine the information contained in existing C-SCRM government
    and industry resources with the information gathered during the 2015 and 2019
    NIST research initiatives.
