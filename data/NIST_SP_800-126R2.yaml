abstract:
- content: This document provides the definitive technical specification for version
    1.2 of the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). SCAP consists of a suite
    of specifications for standardizing the format and nomenclature by which information
    about software flaws and security configurations is communicated, both to machines
    and humans. This document defines requirements for creating and processing SCAP
    content. These requirements build on the requirements defined within the individual
    SCAP component specifications. Each new requirement pertains either to using multiple
    component specifications together or to further constraining one of the individual
    component specifications.
