abstract:
- content: 'A wired sensor network was created to measure water-flow rate in a fire
    hose. An integrated electronic piezoelectric (IEPE) accelerometer was chosen as
    the sensor to measure the flow rate based on the vibrations generated by water
    flowing through a fire hose. These sensors are small, lightweight, and they can
    be attached to the outside of the hose, not obstructing the water¿̐¿s flow path.
    A relationship was determined between the flow rate of the water and vibration
    detected by the accelerometer for a range of flow rates. The raw acceleration
    signal was used to calculate two metrics: the dominant frequency and the standard
    deviation of acceleration. In a future study, the relationship between the dominant-frequency
    metric and the flow rate will be applied to a wireless accelerometer network.
    The relationship will be used to determine the real-time fire hose flow rate critical
    for improving situational awareness on the fireground.'
