abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in support of
    the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Mammal Health and
    Stranding Response Program (NOAA/MMHSRP), conducts annual interlaboratory comparison
    exercises for the determination of chlorinated pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl
    congeners (PCBs), and trace elements in marine mammal tissues. These exercises
    provide one mechanism for laboratories to evaluate their measurement quality and
    comparability for these constituents in marine mammal tissues. In the 2005 exercise,
    4 and 17 laboratories participated in determining the concentrations of selected
    fatty acids and PCBs and organochlorine pesticides, respectively, in a homogenized
    blubber control material Marine Mammal Quality Assurance Exercise Homogenate VII
    (Homogenate VII) and Standard Reference Material (SRM) 1945 Organics in Whale
    Blubber. This report includes the results reported by the participating laboratories,
    combined consensus data results, and summary statistics for each analyte in the
    samples. The numerical indices used to assess laboratory performance are also
    discussed.
