abstract:
- content: A wide range of cooking fire experiments were conducted to examine the
    effectiveness of retrofit residential kitchen fire suppression systems. A series
    of experiments provided data on the hazard associated with cooking oil fires.
    Then, a series of real-scale fire suppression experiments followed using scenarios
    outlined in UL 300A draft standard testing various fire suppression systems. Experiments
    were conducted in a full-scale residential kitchen with dimensions 3.6 m x 3.4
    m x 2.4 m high. Both gas and electric ranges were used. Several types of cooking
    vessel and oil types were tested. The suppression systems tested included automatic
    and manual suppression technologies. The manual devices included wet and dry chemical
    type extinguishers. The automatic systems included room-wide and range hood installed
    systems. The room wide systems included water mist and a residential sprinkler
    systems. The hood installed systems included water mist and wet and dry chemical
    systems. Manual extinguishers consistently suppressed the oil fires while maintaining
    tenable conditions in the mock-up kitchen. One hood-installed wet chemical system
    tested demonstrated success in extinguishing the oil fires in all experiments,
    and maintained tenability in the mock up kitchen throughout most of the experiments.
    The hood-installed dry chemical system tested failed to extinguish the oil fire
    in all experiments, and introduced tenability hazards not present prior to the
    system activation. All other system types tested provided mixed results, they
    either could not reliably suppress the fire, or they consistently generated tenability
    hazards in the test kitchen. The results of these experiments point the need to
    develop other approaches to kitchen fire safety such as ignition prevention technologies
    and reliable early nuisance-free warning through smoke alarms.
