abstract:
- content: In the past decade, numerous public and private sector documents have highlighted
    the need for materials data to facilitate advanced technologies in myriad industrial
    and economic sectors. These documents have been analyzed to identify prevalent
    gaps in the establishment of an interconnected materials data infrastructure akin
    to that envisioned in the federal agency-wide Materials Genome Initiative. This
    internal report uses a uniform schematic format to portray these gaps, illustrate
    progress in addressing the gaps, and propose an MML roadmap of action items to
    further address the gaps.
