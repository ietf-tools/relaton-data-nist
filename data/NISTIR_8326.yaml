abstract:
- content: Simulation and optimization must be used together to design and operate
    large-scale, complex systems. Integrating them presents a number of conceptual
    and technical problems, which can be addressed with more expressive, computer-interpretable
    system models. This paper presents a model-driven approach to integrating simulation
    and optimization methods by exchanging system designs that specialize analysis
    abstractions, both defined in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The analysis
    abstractions enable translation of system models to corresponding analysis models
    and tool interfaces. This approach (model-driven system-analysis integration)
    is demonstrated by developing a multi-fidelity, multi-method simulation optimization
    methodology and applying it to a supply chain design case study.
