abstract:
- content: A web-based radiation code, OpenSC, is developed to provide an ease-of-use
    calculation tool to evaluate total emissivity and total absorptivity of a typical
    combustion mixture consisting of H2O, CO2, N2, O2, and/or soot particulates. The
    web-based calculation tool utilizes the mathematical formulation of a neural network-based
    correlation (RAD-NNET) and accounts for the realistic emission/absorption effect
    of non-gray gases and soot particulates. A set of examples is provided to illustrate
    the use of OpenSC to determine the total emissivity and total absorptivity for
    H2O/CO2/N2/soot mixture in various conditions. Commonly accepted approximate approaches
    used in fire safety/protection design calculations for the evaluation of non-gray
    effects for radiation heat transfer, as recommended by engineering handbooks,
    are assessed. In comparison to results generated by OpenSC, error associated with
    the predictions obtained from using the approximate approaches is substantial.
    Quantitative comparison also demonstrates that the gray assumption with the total
    emissivity equal to the total absorptivity is generally invalid. The emissivity
    chart method, an approach which has been accepted by many practicing engineers
    in the fire safety community, can lead to substantial error.
