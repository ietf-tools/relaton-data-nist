abstract:
- content: The NIST Health Assessment Measurements Quality Assurance Program (HAMQAP)
    was launched in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office
    of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2017. HAMQAP was established to enable laboratories
    to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance with various
    regulations by measuring samples that represent human intake (e.g., foods, dietary
    supplements, tobacco) and samples that represent human output (e.g., blood, serum,
    plasma, urine) for demonstration of proficiency and/or compliance with various
    regulations. Analytes are paired where possible to represent the full spectrum
    of health assessment. Exercise 2 of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories
    to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (iodine), contaminants
    (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and selenium), water-soluble vitamins (folates),
    fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A and E), fatty acids, and natural product compounds
    (eleutherosides and co-enzyme Q10) in foods and dietary supplements, and biomarkers/metabolites
    in clinical specimens (including human serum, blood, and urine).
