abstract:
- content: ASHRAE Standard 135- BACnet--A Data Communication Protocol for Building
    Automation and Control Networks defines a communications protocol for information
    exchange between components of a distributed building automation and control system.
    The proliferation of BACnet enabled heating, ventilating, and air conditioning
    (HVAC) systems has enabled direct access to HVAC system data. The BACnet communications
    dynamic linked library (DLL) enables researchers to implement selected BACnet
    communications, creating an interface for data collection that is easy to use.
    The ability to access HVAC controllers from a computer is valuable because it
    allows researchers, designers, or other users to retrieve data directly from the
    BACnet objects on the controllers. These data could include information on the
    conditions in the building space served by the equipment, the conditions and status
    of the equipment, the actions the controller is currently taking, and other values
    that may be set by internal program logic. These data could then be used for a
    variety of research purposes, including real-time monitoring of the HVAC system,
    commissioning, fault detection and diagnostics (FDD), data logging, or other applications.
    Researchers can integrate the BACnet communications DLL (BCD) into existing tools,
    create a new tool with the BCD, or use the BCD with common data acquisition and
    analysis tools.
