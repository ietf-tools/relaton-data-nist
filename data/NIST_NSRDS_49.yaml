abstract:
- content: CYCLE_D simulates vapor compression refrigeration cycles that use single-compound
    refrigerants or refrigerant blends. The model can simulate a basic subcritical
    or transcritical refrigeration cycle, both with or without a liquid-line/suction-line
    heat exchanger. In addition, the model can simulate a subcritical two-stage economizer
    cycle, a subcritical three- stage economizer cycle, and a subcritical two-stage
    compression cycle with intercooling. CYCLE_D includes 70 single-compound refrigerants
    and 97 predefined blends. Single-compound fluids can be combined to form blends
    of up to five components. Computationally, the program is fully compatible with
    the NIST Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties - REFPROP, Version
    9.1.
