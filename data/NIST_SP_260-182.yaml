abstract:
- content: Rheological measurements are often performed using a rotational rheometer.
    In this type of rheometer, the tested fluid is sheared between two surfaces, one
    of which is rotating [1]. Usually, an angular velocity is imposed on the fluid
    (through the rotating surface) and this angular velocity determines the shear
    rate the fluid is subjected to. The response of the material is monitored by the
    measurement of the resultant torque on the shaft of the rheometer; this torque
    can then be converted to shear stress. In order to calibrate a rheometer, a standard
    oil of known viscosity should be tested in the rheometer to verify that the instrument
    is operating correctly. However, these standard oils are expensive; which makes
    it impractical for use in calibrating with the rheometer with a large capacity
    as needed for concrete. Additional, these standard oils that are not suspensions
    (i.e. they do not have solid particles suspended in the media), and thus using
    them may not capture some issues that may occur in a suspension rheology. Therefore,
    a relatively inexpensive, reference material is needed that incorporates aggregates
    for concrete rheometers. As concrete and mortar are non-Newtonian, the reference
    material should also be non-Newtonian. This report follows the development and
    serves as re-certification of a Standard Reference Material (SRM) for cement paste
    [2]. A multiscale approach will be utilized to develop SRMs for mortar and concrete
    in the future. The SRM 2492 will be the matrix fluid for a mortar SRM that will
    in turn become the matrix fluid for a concrete SRM. The report SP 260-174 Rev.2012
    [2] describes how this SRM 2492, a Bingham Paste Mixture for Rheological Measurements
    was developed and provides all the details on the various ingredients. After an
    inter-laboratory study under the sponsorship of the American Concrete Institute
    (ACI) committee 238, Workability of Fresh Concrete, it was found that the instructions
    provided to prepare the SRM were inadequate to obtain reproducible data in all
    laboratories. Thus after establishing a better preparation method, new instructions
    were drafted and it was found that the certified values were no longer valid.
    Thus, it was necessary to redo a series of testing to obtain a new certified value.
    This report provides all measurements obtained, the calculation of the new rheological
    characteristics and the statistical analyses.
