abstract:
- content: NIST has developed a user-friendly spreadsheet-based software package for
    the Master Curve analysis of fracture toughness tests performed in the ductile-to-brittle
    transition region and the determination of the reference temperature To, in accordance
    with ASTM E1921-21. The software consists of multiple spreadsheets, which feature
    several macros that automate most calculations. The software package applies to
    the analysis of both macroscopically homogeneous and inhomogeneous materials.
    Complete user's instructions are provided in this report. The software has been
    successfully validated using several example problems provided in ASTM E1921-21.
    As in the case of previous software packages developed by the Fatigue and Fracture
    Group of NIST in Boulder, the spreadsheet will be made freely available to the
    public by contacting the author of this report (enrico.lucon@nist.gov).
