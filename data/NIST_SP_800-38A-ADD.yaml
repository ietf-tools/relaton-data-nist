abstract:
- content: A limitation to Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, as specified in NIST
    Special Publication 800-38A, is that the plaintext input must consist of a sequence
    of blocks. Ciphertext stealing is a padding method in which the required padding
    bits are stolen from the penultimate ciphertext block. This addendum to SP 800-38A
    specifies three variants of CBC mode with ciphertext stealing. These variants,
    which differ only in the ordering of the ciphertext bits, can encrypt any input
    whose bit length is greater than or equal to the block size. Unlike conventional
    padding methods, these variants do not expand the length of the data.
