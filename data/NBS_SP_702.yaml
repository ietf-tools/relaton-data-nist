abstract:
- content: 'To assist in building a computerized information system on the engineering
    properties of materials, the standards and metadata requirements for a representative
    group of mechanical property categories are considered. These categories include:
    tensile behavior, hardness numbers, notch-bar impact test parameters and fatigue
    properties. For each property group, definitions of terms, synonyms (and non-synonyms),
    standard test methods, standards for reporting data, precision and accuracy, and
    correlations of properties are addressed. The principal findings and recommendations
    are as follows. Existing test methods are generally adequate for the properties
    considered but better standards are needed for data reporting. Appraisal of materials
    variability and testing machine variability would be assisted by acess to standard
    reference materials, certified as to their mechanical properties.'
