abstract:
- content: This publication describes a basis for establishing principles, concepts,
    activities, and tasks for engineering trustworthy secure systems. Such principles,
    concepts, activities, and tasks can be effectively applied within systems engineering
    efforts to foster a common mindset to deliver security for any system, regardless
    of the system's purpose, type, scope, size, complexity, or the stage of its system
    life cycle. The intent of this publication is to advance systems engineering in
    developing trustworthy systems for contested operational environments (generally
    referred to as systems security engineering) and to serve as a basis for developing
    educational and training programs, professional certifications, and other assessment
    criteria.
