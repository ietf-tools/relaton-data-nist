abstract:
- content: 'In recent years, investigations have been conducted at NIST (as a collaboration
    between the Fatigue and Fracture Group in Boulder, CO and the Force and Mass Group
    in Gaithersburg, MD) toward an SI-traceable dynamic calibration of instrumented
    Charpy strikers. Although Charpy tests are few-millisecond-duration events in
    which dynamic phenomena are often clearly present, the force measurements from
    instrumented Charpy tests are predominantly obtained using static calibrations,
    which has long been recognized as a potential source of significant errors. Several
    approaches to dynamic calibration have been considered for this work, including
    methods that have previously been implemented at NIST and elsewhere, and methods
    that are new in the sense that they are not commonly used or incorporated into
    standards. A key objective of these investigations is that the calibration be
    traceable to the International System of Units. A summary of the activities conducted
    between January and December 2017 was published as NIST TN 1991, issued in May
    2018 with the title ''Investigations on SI-Traceable Dynamic Calibration of Instrumented
    Charpy Strikers,'' authors: A. Chijoke, N. Vlaijc, E. Mulhern, and E. Lucon. A
    paper on investigations aimed at optimizing the design of an instrumented Charpy
    striker were summarized in a paper titled ''Design Considerations to Optimize
    Charpy Instrumented Strikers'' (authors: N. Vlaijc, A. Chijoke, and E. Lucon).
    The paper was submitted in 2018 but has not yet been published at the time of
    writing, being still in review after initial rejections. The activities and accomplishments
    of this project during FY2019 are described in this Technical Note.'
