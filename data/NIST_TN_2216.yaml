abstract:
- content: Instrumentation generates data faster and in higher quantity than ever
    before, and interlaboratory research is in historic demand domestically and internationally
    to stimulate economic innovation. Strategic mission needs of the NIST Material
    Measurement Laboratory (MML) to support a wide array of research disciplines therefore
    compel our organization to adopt advanced strategies for research data management.
    Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) provide a framework for managing
    data from the outset of the research life cycle delivering new capabilities for
    machine learning, data analysis, collaboration, and dissemination. This roadmap
    describes our current understanding and strategy for adapting our research workflows
    for LIMS throughout MML by embracing the use of standards and best practices from
    data science communities. The NIST research data cyber infrastructure complements
    these goals for MML by providing a secure environment to host LIMS solutions.
    Additionally, integration of scientific workflows requires ongoing collaboration
    to bridge organizational LIMS with external scientific communities. Thus, MML
    LIMS will evolve overtime in synergy with the technology and experimental environments
    delivering new science. LIMS will broaden our mission impact through adoption
    of FAIR data principles.
