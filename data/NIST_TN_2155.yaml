abstract:
- content: This paper describes a dataset, IrisDaily-NIST, that is under construction
    by NIST. At the present, this dataset has (nearly) daily iris images of a single
    subject collected with a commercial iris camera over a period of approximately
    4 months. The purpose of the dataset is to enable evaluation of long and short
    term variability in match scores under optimal conditions. We present initial
    analysis of the data using two commercially available algorithms.
