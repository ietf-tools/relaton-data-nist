abstract:
- content: This paper uses a Monte Carlo simulation program to explore various aspects
    of uncertainties associated with the measurement of the noise parameters of transistors
    on wafers. The dependence of the noise-parameter uncertainties on the different
    input uncertainties is investigated in detail. Other issues that are considered
    include the effect of probe losses, the importance (or not) of including input
    terminations with reflection coefficients as near as possible to the edge of the
    Smith chart, improvements due to inclusion of an input termination with noise
    temperature well below ambient, and the effect of including a 'reverse' measurement.
    We also briefly consider the case of well-matched amplifiers on wafers.
