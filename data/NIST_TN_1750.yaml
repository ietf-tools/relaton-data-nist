abstract:
- content: 'In 2006, researchers from 22 organizations in ten countries began a joint
    effort to enable the cost-effective commissioning of existing and future buildings
    to improve the buildings'' operating performance. The commissioning techniques
    developed through this Annex are intended to help transition the industry from
    the intuitive approach, currently employed in the operation of buildings, to more
    systematic operation focusing on achieving significant energy savings. Key outputs
    of IEA - ECBCS Annex 47 include: - Methods and tools for commissioning advanced
    systems and low energy buildings; - Methods and tools for field application; -
    Information on the costs and benefits that can be used to promote the wider use
    of commissioning. This report presents an extended summary of the research results.'
