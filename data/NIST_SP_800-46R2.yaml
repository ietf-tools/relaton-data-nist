abstract:
- content: For many organizations, their employees, contractors, business partners,
    vendors, and/or others use enterprise telework or remote access technologies to
    perform work from external locations. All components of these technologies, including
    organization-issued and bring your own device (BYOD) client devices, should be
    secured against expected threats as identified through threat models. This publication
    provides information on security considerations for several types of remote access
    solutions, and it makes recommendations for securing a variety of telework, remote
    access, and BYOD technologies. It also gives advice on creating related security
    policies.
