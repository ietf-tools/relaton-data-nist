abstract:
- content: This paper presents the findings of a study initially conducted to measure
    the operational impact of JPEG 2000 lossy compression on 1000 ppi fingerprint
    imagery at various levels of compression, but later expanded to include lossless
    compression. Lossless compression will have no impact on either Galton or non-Galton
    based features of a fingerprint since the compressed image is identical to the
    original once decompressed. The selection of a lossless compression algorithm
    can have operational implications in terms of effective compression rate and throughput;
    these implications are the focus. This study examines several such compression
    algorithms and compares them using criteria used to measure the effectiveness
    of the compression algorithm as well as its throughput using actual fingerprint
    imagery.
