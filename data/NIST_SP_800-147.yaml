abstract:
- content: This document provides guidelines for preventing the unauthorized modification
    of Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware on PC client systems. Unauthorized
    modification of BIOS firmware by malicious software constitutes a significant
    threat because of the BIOS⁰₉s unique and privileged position within the PC architecture.
    A malicious BIOS modification could be part of a sophisticated, targeted attack
    on an organization ⁰₄either a permanent denial of service (if the BIOS is corrupted)
    or a persistent malware presence (if the BIOS is implanted with malware). As used
    in this publication, the term BIOS refers to conventional BIOS, Extensible Firmware
    Interface (EFI) BIOS, and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) BIOS. This
    document applies to system BIOS firmware (e.g., conventional BIOS or UEFI BIOS)
    stored in the system flash memory of computer systems, including portions that
    may be formatted as Option ROMs. However, it does not apply to Option ROMs, UEFI
    drivers, and firmware stored elsewhere in a computer system. While this document
    focuses on current and future x86 and x64 client platforms, the controls and procedures
    are independent of any particular system design. Likewise, although the guide
    is oriented toward enterprise-class platforms, the necessary technologies are
    expected to migrate to consumer-grade systems over time. Future efforts may look
    at boot firmware security for enterprise server platforms.
