abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM) 1936 Great Lakes Sediment is intended
    for 1) use in validating calibration and validation materials for sediment analysis
    methods and 2) value assigning in house produced control materials analyzed using
    those methods. A unit of SRM 1936 consists of one bottle containing approximately
    50 g of radiation-sterilized, dried sediment from Milwaukee Bay, WI, USA. This
    publication documents the production, analytical methods, and statistical evaluations
    used to characterize this material.
