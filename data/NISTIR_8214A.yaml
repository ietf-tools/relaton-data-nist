abstract:
- content: 'This document constitutes a preparation toward devising criteria for the
    standardization of threshold schemes for cryptographic primitives by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The large diversity of possible
    threshold schemes, as identified in the NIST Internal Report (NISTIR) 8214, is
    structured along two main tracks: single-device and multi-party. Each track covers
    cryptographic primitives in several possible threshold modes. The potential for
    real-world applications is taken as an important motivating factor for differentiating
    the pertinence of each possible threshold scheme. Also, the selection of items
    for standardization needs to consider diverse features, such as advanced security
    properties, configurability of parameters, testing and validation, modularity
    and composability (e.g., of gadgets vs. composites), and specification detail.
    Overall, the organization put forward serves as a preparation for an upcoming
    solicitation of feedback useful for considering a variety of threshold schemes,
    while differentiating standardization paths and timelines that may depend on the
    levels of technical and standardization challenges. This approach paves the way
    for an effective engagement with the community of stakeholders and constitutes
    a preparation for devising criteria for standardization and subsequent calls for
    contributions. While the terms standards and standardization are used throughout
    this report to refer to a set of possible final products, this does not imply
    a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) as one or as the only intended
    format for NIST products of future threshold schemes for cryptographic primitives.'
