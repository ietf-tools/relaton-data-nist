abstract:
- content: Observations in previous studies have shown that contactless capture devices
    may be prone to capturing superfluous data (e.g., fingernail or finger background),
    distortion and imaging artifacts especially around the periphery of the captured
    fingerprint images, as well as not being able to consistently capture certain
    fingers from each hand. This study tests the hypothesis that eliminating certain
    error prone fingers, or eliminating some of the periphery of all fingerprint images,
    may yield an improvement in the matcher s ability to make an identification as
    well as possibly improving the service time from the matcher.
