abstract:
- content: In NIST TN 1973 [1], we develop a methodology for estimating seismic retrofit
    costs. The general approach is to build a predictive model of seismic retrofit
    costs that (1) captures the essential factors that drive costs, such as building
    construction type and square footage; and (2) is reproducible using data available
    to decision makers. In this report, we apply the methodology to generate retrofit
    cost predictions for typical federal buildings. Typical federal buildings are
    meant to be statistically representative of the federal building inventory, but
    are not actual federal buildings. Our results suggest that retrofitting an entire
    typical building inventory for life safety will cost about +/- 2 0 billion. The
    caveat is that our model only predicts structural mitigation costs. Other construction
    costs, as well as non-structural mitigation costs, can easily increase the total
    cost. Presidential Executive Order 13717 (EO 13717), Establishing a Federal Earthquake
    Risk Management Standard, encourages federal agencies to enhance resilience...[to]
    future earthquakes by evaluating and retrofitting existing federal buildings based
    on current existing building codes. This report, together with NIST TN 1973 [1],
    provides a roadmap for building owners to quickly approximate expected seismic
    retrofit costs.
