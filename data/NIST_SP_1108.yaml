abstract:
- content: Under the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is assigned 'primary responsibility
    to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards
    for information management to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and
    systems.' [EISA Title XIII, Section 1305]. There is an urgent need to establish
    these standards. Recognizing the urgency, NIST developed a three-phase plan to
    accelerate the identification of standards while establishing a robust framework
    for the longer-term evolution of the standards and establishment of testing and
    certification procedures. This report is the output of Phase 1. It describes a
    high-level reference model for the Smart Grid, identifies nearly 80 existing standards
    that can be used now to support Smart Grid development, identifies 14 high priority
    gaps, plus cyber security, for which new or revised standards are needed, documents
    action plans with aggressive timelines by which designated Standards Development
    Organizations are tasked to fill these gaps, and describes the strategy being
    pursued to establish standards for ensuring cyber security of the Smart Grid.
