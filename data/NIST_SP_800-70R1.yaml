abstract:
- content: A security configuration checklist is a series of instructions for configuring
    a product to a particular operational environment. Checklists can comprise templates
    or automated scripts, patches or patch descriptions, XML files, and other procedures.
    Checklists are intended to be tailored by each organization to meet its particular
    security and operational requirements. The use of well-written, standardized checklists
    can markedly reduce the vulnerability exposure of IT products. This publication
    gives an overview of the NIST National Checklist Program, explains how to retrieve
    checklists from the NIST National Checklist Repository, and provides general information
    about threat discussions and baseline technical security practices for associated
    operational environments.
