abstract:
- content: Thorough and unambiguous definitions of a broad set of on-machine measurement
    use cases and information are offered. Relevant in-situ and off-machine measurement
    use cases are also described in some detail, due to their close relationship to
    on-machine measurement. The use cases are defined to expose a comprehensive scope
    of information useful to manufacturing information standards bodies. Activity
    diagrams for on-machine measurement are presented which help clarify the use cases
    and information elements required for on-machine measurement. Due to the lack
    of definitional consensus on terms and definitions for on-machine measurement
    in the literature, a broad scope of terms required by the numerous and varied
    types of quality measurement use cases commonly performed on or around machine
    tools are precisely defined, while seeking to remain faithful to definitional
    usage common in industry and academia.
