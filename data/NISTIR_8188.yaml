abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology has constructed a testbed
    to measure the performance impact induced by cybersecurity technologies on Industrial
    Control Systems (ICS). The testbed allows researchers to emulate real-world industrial
    manufacturing processes and their control systems without the need to replicate
    an entire production or factory environment. The focus of this report is the Process
    Control System of the Testbed, which emulate an industrial continuous manufacturing
    system. A continuous manufacturing is a process to manufacture, produce, or process
    materials without interruption, the materials being processed are continuously
    in motion, undergoing chemical reactions or subject to mechanical or heat treatment.
    Continuous manufacturing usually implies a 24x7 operation with infrequent maintenance
    shutdowns. Continuous manufacturing is contrasted with batch manufacturing . Examples
    of continuous manufacturing include, chemical production, oil refining, natural
    gas processing, and waste water treatment process.
