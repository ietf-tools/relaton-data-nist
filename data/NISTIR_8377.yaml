abstract:
- content: 'More than 300 individuals from 150 organizations across 26 countries and
    regions use the NIST released Media Forensic Challenge (MFC) datasets for their
    research. The MFC datasets were created for use in the DARPA MediFor (Media Forensics)
    program. Since their release, multiple questions have been fielded regarding the
    dataset properties, including contents, metadata definitions, usage, data repurposing,
    etc. For example: what do the datasets contain? What are the definitions of the
    different kinds of metadata? How does one label the data with the reference information
    to build the training data for machine learning algorithms? How would one modify/extract
    the data for their own research purposes? This document serves as a user guide
    for the MFC datasets, including those used in the Nimble Challenge (NC). This
    guide includes: 1) a description about MFC datasets including background, evolution
    history, and the dataset summary by the evaluation tasks; 2) user access and permissions
    of MFC datasets; 3) an introduction to the MFC data by providing a simple example
    of a manipulation journal graph and its detailed corresponding MFC dataset reference
    files; 4) an introduction to a flexible subset selection approach, Selective Scoring,
    to sample the test probes from the entire test set for the particular task evaluation;
    5) information to help users gain a deeper understanding of the metadata by presenting
    two commonly used approaches to illustrate the manipulation operation statistic
    histogram distributions, and 6) a general template of the NIST MFC evaluation
    dataset to facilitate the future dataset generation.'
