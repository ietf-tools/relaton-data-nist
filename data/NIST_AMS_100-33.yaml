abstract:
- content: 'A two-day workshop was held at the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD on December 2 - 3, 2019 on the subject of
    defining and prioritizing standards needed for 3-dimensional robotic perception
    systems for part localization, part recognition, part capture, and complex assembly.
    The event had 28 attendees, including 10 NIST personnel. The work seeks to benefit
    both vendors and users in the 3D perception industry through the development of
    new standards for a variety of use cases. Key results from the workshop were:
    1) a ranked list of 39 standards needed, 2) six of the highest ranked standards
    were developed into ASTM work items, and 3) several of the attendees from industry
    agreed to champion some of the six work items. This document is a report on the
    various presentations, activities, decisions, and interactions that happened during
    and prior to the workshop.'
