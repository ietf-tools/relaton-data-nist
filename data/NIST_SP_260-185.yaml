abstract:
- content: This report presents a correlated height and width measurement model for
    particle size analysis of spherical particles by atomic force microscopy (AFM).
    It is complementary to more familiar methods based on a single value of the particle
    height or on a line average obtained from a close-packed particle array. Significant
    influence quantities affecting the determination of average particle size and
    its uncertainty are considered for the important case of polystyrene latex (PSL)
    reference materials. Particlesubstrate deformation, resulting from adhesive contact
    between particle and substrate during sample preparation, is estimated as a function
    of particle size. Post-processing of AFM datasets is explored as a means of eliminating
    bias due to non-steady state measurement conditions. These biases arise from variable
    particle-tip interaction caused by drift of instrumental parameters from their
    optimal settings during long acquisition times and inevitable wear of the AFM
    probe. Changes of the initial probe shape are established using a Si/SiO2 multilayer
    tip characterizer and are updated periodically during the analysis of sequential
    data sets for combinations of several particles sizes and different probes. Finally,
    the capability of this procedure to serve as a statistical error-correction scheme
    in AFM particle-size metrology is assessed.
