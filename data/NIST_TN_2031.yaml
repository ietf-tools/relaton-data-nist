abstract:
- content: Measurements were made to characterize the time-varying temperature field
    in a medium-sized methyl alcohol (methanol; CH3OH) pool fire steadily burning
    in a quiescent environment. A digital camera fitted with optical filters and a
    zoom lens was used to record the high temperature emission intensity of 14 ℗ÿm
    diameter Type S Silicon-Carbide filaments oriented horizontally at various heights
    above a central cross-section of a steadily burning 0.30 m diameter methanol pool
    fire. The camera optics focused on the filaments with a field of view of approximately
    0.3 m wide by 0.6 m high. Using the optical camera, the filament was observable
    only for temperatures larger than 1150 K. Experiments were conducted to collect
    thousands of frames of 30 Hz video. In a separate experiment, a 50 ℗ÿm diameter
    thermocouple was used to acquire 3400 independent temperature measurements at
    several locations in the high temperature zone of the fire. A correlation was
    developed between the probability density functions of the radiation-corrected
    thermocouple measurements and the camera grayscale pixel intensity of the filament
    for the same fire locations. Assuming a Gaussian temperature distribution, a fitting
    routine was used to determine the mean temperature and its variance from the calculated
    filament temperature. The mean temperatures compared favorably to previously reported
    measurements. False color maps of temperature were produced characterizing the
    entire high temperature flow field as a function of time. The time-averaged temperature
    field for each phase of the pulsing methanol fire was also determined. The results
    provide insight into the dynamic character of turbulent pool fires.
