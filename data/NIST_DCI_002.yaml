abstract:
- content: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up 44% of U.S. economic
    activities and are the lifeline for many local economies, employing 59 million
    people in 2018 (SBA 2018, 2019). In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, small-
    and medium-sized (SMEs) are greatly impacted through supply- and demand-side difficulties,
    such as limiting customer interactions, employee availability, as well as larger
    supply chain issues. The numbers are quickly evolving, but early predictions estimate
    15,000 retail store closures and 3 million jobs lost (Bivens, 2020; Thomas, 2020)
    with minority and immigrant-owned businesses disproportionately affected (Fairlie,
    2020). As COVID-19 conditions persist, the chances are high that populations around
    the US and the world will experience natural disasters (e.g., heat waves, floods,
    hurricanes, fire, and drought) during the period of virus transmission and into
    the period of recovery (e.g., Phillips et al., 2020). SMEs in areas vulnerable
    to these natural disasters and other extreme weather events (EWEs) are particularly
    noteworthy in the context of COVID-19. This Special Publication Report presents
    a mixed-method research approach to study the impact of COVID-19 on SMEs and a
    subset thereof which had experienced a natural disaster or EWE pre- or during
    the COVID-19 transmission period. The survey also gauges the concern that such
    events may affect SMEs as the effects of COVID-19 persist in the future and during
    a future recovery phase. The presented survey was conducted online and combines
    quantitative and qualitative questions to document (1) the novel resilience-based
    mitigation actions employed during the COVID-19 pandemic by SMEs, (2) challenges
    in implementing resilience-based mitigation actions, (3) use of past strategies
    and approaches to provide assistance to the current situation, and (4) planned
    resilience actions and strategies. As such, the questions are framed specific
    to COVID-19 pandemic conditions; however, many are generalizable to SMEs facing
    compound risks that may create complex events.
