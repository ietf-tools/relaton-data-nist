abstract:
- content: Latent fingerprints are made visible from the surface of objects using
    a variety of methods including physical and chemical processing, adapted illumination
    sources, and photographs. Unfortunately, the prints collected directly from a
    crime scene or from physical evidence may be incomplete or damaged, to the point
    of being considered unsuitable to send directly to latent fingerprint examiners
    for identification or to Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for
    recognition. As a result, most latent fingerprint images must be preprocessed
    to enhance fingerprint information, at the same time suppressing interference
    arising from noise and otherwise unwanted image features. This preprocessing phase
    occurs after the latent print is collected from the crime scene and digitalized
    by a scanner or camera, and before the image analysis and process phase such as
    minutiae markup or latent print identification. The preprocessing results can
    be extraordinary, transforming raw images with little or no value into ones suitable
    for evidentiary analysis. Despite the importance of this step, there exist few
    databases designed especially for the scientific study of latent fingerprint image
    preprocessing, and even fewer standards to guide this workflow. To address this
    research gap, we conducted a study in which a group of trained Latent Print Examiners
    provided Extended Feature Set (EFS) markups of a series of latent images. This
    report provides a brief introduction into fingerprint preprocessing, discussion
    regarding the experimental design, structure, and contents of the latent fingerprint
    image database, and details of proposed preprocessing efficacy metrics. Additionally,
    we present preliminary analysis of these metrics when applied to images in our
    database. Previously Guan et al. [6] presented the performance metrics and analysis
    of the metrics as applied to a union minutiae set. In this report, we comprehensively
    document the contents of the records database including the latent images, the
    EFS markup files, metadata, markup logs, and region of interest masks. Additionally,
    we present the results of the performance metrics as applied to the intersection
    minutiae set of EFS markup data.
