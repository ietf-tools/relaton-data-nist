abstract:
- content: This report documents the equation of state for fluid helium implemented
    in Version 10 of NISTâ€™s REFPROP Standard Reference Database. The equation of state
    is expressed as the molar Helmholtz energy as a function of temperature and density,
    and is valid for the normal fluid (helium I) up to 1500 K and 2000 MPa. Limited
    comparisons with experimental data and with virial coefficients calculated by
    ab initio methods are provided.
