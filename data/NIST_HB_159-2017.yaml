abstract:
- content: 'State and local weights and measures jurisdictions or other testing laboratories
    that use transfer standards developed using the air-oven reference methods (referred
    to as air-oven reference standards) to test commercial grain moisture meters,
    collect grains that are typically grown and traded in their State, and transport
    them to their laboratory for testing. In the laboratory, these grains are cleaned,
    mixed, and tested for moisture content and weight per bushel. The grains are then
    divided into smaller grain samples and assigned moisture and weight per bushel
    reference values. These samples with known reference moisture and weight per bushel
    values are issued to weights and measures officials to test commercial grain moisture
    meters in accordance with NIST Handbook 44, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other
    Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices, Section 5.56.(a) Grain
    Moisture Meters. Commercial grain moisture meters are meters that provide rapid
    grain moisture content to a buyer. The moisture content of grain is used to determine
    the amount of money a seller will receive for the grain. For example, if grain
    moisture content is too high, the buyer must dry the grain before storage, so
    cost adjustments are made by the buyer to offset the cost for drying. Conversely,
    if the moisture is too low the grain quality may be affected and cost adjustments
    may be made for low moisture. This reference manual provides technical guidelines
    for: (1) laboratory grain sample preparation and testing; and (2) the field evaluation
    of grain moisture meters, in accordance with NIST Handbook 44, Section 5.56.(a)
    for field testing using air-oven reference method transfer standards.'
