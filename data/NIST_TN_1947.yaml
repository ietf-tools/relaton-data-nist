abstract:
- content: Research was conducted on the performance of currently available smoke
    alarms to the new fire and cooking nuisance source tests specified in ANSI/UL
    217-2015, Standard for Safety of Smoke Alarms. The standard calls for additional
    room-scale fire tests with smoldering and flaming polyurethane foam and a broiling
    hamburgers cooking test. The objectives of this research was to assess whether
    the new performance tests will foster a demonstrable enhancement in smoke alarm
    performance compared to a wide range of currently available smoke alarms and whether
    the single nuisance source test is representative of a range of cooking nuisance
    scenarios. There were 45 distinct smoke alarm models from seven different manufacturers
    used in the study. There were 14 ionization sensor models, 14 photoelectric sensor
    models, seven combination photoelectric and carbon monoxide sensor models, four
    combination ionization and carbon monoxide sensor models, four combination ionization
    and photoelectric sensor models, and two combination photoelectric and thermal
    sensor models. Six units of each model were used in the experiments for a total
    of 270 individual smoke alarms used in the study. The sensitivity of each alarm
    was measured in a smoke box with cotton wick smoke per the ANSI/UL 217-2012. The
    measured sensitivities across the different models covered nearly the entire range
    of allowed sensitivities. Analysis of these results showed that no current smoke
    alarm model would likely meet the new test performance levels required in the
    ANSI/UL 217-2015. Three models, all photoelectric sensor alarms, came closest
    to meeting the requirements. It was concluded that an across the board increase
    to the level of performance specified in ANSI-UL 217-2015 would significantly
    improve the overall performance of smoke alarms by expanding the range of fire
    scenarios alarms must respond to while requiring resistance to nuisance alarms.
    The changes introduced in ANSI/UL 217-2015, which include the new performance
    fire tests and the new nuisance resistance test, may represent significant challenges
    for manufacturers to meet the requirements by simply using both photoelectric
    and ionization sensors, or designing alarms that perform as well against the new
    fire tests as combination ionization / photoelectric models examined. The aerosol
    generation rate between the cooking nuisance sources varied significantly as did
    the relationship between the light obscuration and measuring ionization chamber
    values. Toasting bread produced essentially no measurable obscuration, thus alarms
    with only photoelectric, carbon monoxide, and thermal sensors typically did not
    alarm during those experiments. However, ionization alarms did respond to toasting
    bread aerosols at about the same measuring ionization chamber level as the broiling
    hamburgers experiments. As a nuisance test, the broiling hamburgers test challenged
    the majority of smoke alarms included in this study, and therefore may be considered
    a conservative test. Ultimately, cooking nuisance experiments on a range of smoke
    alarms that ANSI/UL 217-2015 will confirm the appropriateness of the broiling
    hamburgers cooking nuisance scenario as the model test.
