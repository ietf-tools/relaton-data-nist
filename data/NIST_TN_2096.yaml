abstract:
- content: Small Punch (SP) testing is a methodology that uses small disk-shaped specimens,
    generally 8 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm thick, to estimate mechanical properties
    of metallic materials, such as tensile properties, fracture toughness, and ductile-to-brittle
    transition temperature. Empirical correlations are typically used to infer conventional
    mechanical properties from characteristic forces and displacements obtained from
    the test record. Most of the available literature relates to SP testing of steels,
    while relatively little information is available for other metallic materials.
    At NIST in Boulder, Colorado, SP tests were conducted on additively manufactured
    (AM) Ti-6Al-4V with different processing parameters and heat treatment conditions.
    The shape of force/punch displacement curves appeared different than typically
    reported for conventionally manufactured steels, and correlations with tensile
    parameters were generally weaker than those published for steel samples. We are
    led to conclude that the application of the SP technique, characterized by a biaxial
    loading mode, to materials with high anisotropy, such as current batches of AM
    Ti-6Al-4V, may be somewhat problematic and therefore of limited applicability.
    Finally, the use of actuator displacement instead of punch displacement in test
    analyses appeared to cause a generalized worsening of the correlations.
