abstract:
- content: Organizations will increasingly use Internet of Things (IoT) devices for
    the mission benefits they can offer, but care must be taken in the acquisition
    and implementation of IoT devices. This publication contains background and recommendations
    to help organizations consider how an IoT device they plan to acquire can integrate
    into a system. IoT devices and their support for security controls are presented
    in the context of organizational and system risk management. This publication
    provides guidance on considering system security from the device perspective.
    This allows for the identification of device cybersecurity requirements the abilities
    and actions an organization will expect from an IoT device and its manufacturer
    and/or third parties, respectively.
