abstract:
- content: This is the third in a series of reports on ongoing face recognition vendor
    tests (FRVT) executed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
    The first two reports cover, respectively, the performance of one-to-one face
    recognition algorithms used for verification of asserted identities, and performance
    of one-to-many face recognition algorithms used for identification of individuals
    in photo data bases. This document extends those evaluations to document accuracy
    variations across demographic groups
