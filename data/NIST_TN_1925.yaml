abstract:
- content: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and others are concerned
    about the hazard of acute carbon monoxide (CO) exposures from portable gasoline
    powered generators that can result in death or serious adverse health effects
    in exposed individuals. As of May 15, 2015, the CPSC databases contain records
    of at least 702 deaths (involving 523 incidents) from CO poisoning in the U.S.
    caused by consumer use of a generator in the period of 2004 through 2014 (Hnatov
    2015). There were an additional 49 CO poisoning deaths (involving 39 incidents)
    associated with consumer use of both a generator and at least one other CO-producing
    consumer appliance, for a total of 751 CO poisoning deaths (involving 562 incidents)
    associated with generators for the same 11-year period. The majority of these
    deaths occurred when consumers used a generator in an enclosed or partially enclosed
    space or outdoors near an open door, window or vent. While avoiding the operation
    of such generators in or near an enclosed space is expected to reduce indoor CO
    exposures significantly, it may not be realistic to expect such usage to be eliminated
    completely. Another means of reducing these exposures would be to decrease the
    rate at which CO is emitted from these devices. A computer simulation study was
    conducted to provide CPSC staff with information to support comparisons of modeled
    residential CO exposures reflecting operation of current designs of portable engine-driven
    electric generators, inside homes or in attached garages. These results were compared
    to simulated operation of reduced emission generators meeting a potential CO emission
    rate limit performance requirement being considered by CPSC staff under portable
    generator rulemaking activities. These simulations employed the multizone airflow
    and contaminant transport model CONTAM, which was applied to a set of 40 buildings
    (consisting of 37 houses and 3 detached garages, considered broadly representative
    of fatal CO poisoning incidents reported in CPSC databases) that are primarily
    based on a collection of models representative of the U.S. housing stock. This
    report presents sample CO and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) simulation results for
    three of the houses and one of the garages modeled. The results presented demonstrate
    that generators with the reduced CO emission rates result in peak CO concentrations
    that can be reduced by 40 % to more than 90 % depending on the specific case being
    analyzed. The reduced CO emission rates also result in significant reductions
    in COHb in many cases. Additionally, use of a thermal building model coupled with
    the airflow and IAQ model to properly account for thermal effects was shown to
    be important as the interaction of the generators heat generation and the ambient
    weather conditions can significantly impact both air change rates and interzone
    airflow patterns in the buildings.
