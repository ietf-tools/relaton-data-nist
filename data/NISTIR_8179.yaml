abstract:
- content: In the modern world, where complex systems and systems-of-systems are integral
    to the functioning of society and businesses, it is increasingly important to
    be able to understand and manage risks that these systems and components may present
    to the missions that they support. However, in the world of finite resources,
    it is not possible to apply equal protection to all assets. This publication describes
    a comprehensive Criticality Analysis Process Model - a structured method of prioritizing
    programs, systems, and components based on their importance to the goals of an
    organization and the impact that their inadequate operation or loss may present
    to those goals. A criticality analysis can help organizations identify and better
    understand the systems, subsystems, components, and subcomponents that are most
    essential to their operations and the environment in which they operate. That
    understanding facilitates better decision making related to the management of
    an organization's information assets, including information security and privacy
    risk management, project management, acquisition, maintenance, and upgrade decisions.
    The Model is structured to logically follow how organizations design and implement
    projects and systems, can be used as a component of a holistic and comprehensive
    risk management approach that considers all risks, and can be used with a variety
    of risk management standards and guidelines.
