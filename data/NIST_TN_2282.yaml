abstract:
- content: 'This report provides an overview of quantitative measurement data and
    visual observations obtained from a series of 52 full-scale fire growth experiments
    conducted on 16 unique combustible solids including: natural and synthetic polymers,
    copolymers, fiberglass-reinforced composite materials, porous polymer foams, and
    electrical cables. Key measurement devices were incorporated into this test apparatus
    in order to measure the primary mechanism controlling fire growth (flame to surface
    heat transfer during upward flame spread over the surface of the combustible solids)
    and to measure global quantities characterizing fire behavior and development:
    heat release rate (HRR), soot and gaseous species (i.e., CO and CO2) yields. This
    information can be used to improve the analysis and determination of fuel loading
    in electrical enclosures, which in turn can be used to define peak fire size (HRR)
    for use in PRAs. Additionally, measurements obtained from these full-scale experiments
    provide a comprehensive source of reference data needed to validate numerical
    models that can predict ignitability, fire growth rate, and peak fire size of
    combustible solids (e.g., materials found in electrical enclosures).'
