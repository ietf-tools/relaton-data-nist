abstract:
- content: Handbook 44 was first printed in 1949, having been preceded by similar
    handbooks of various designations and in several forms. This 2016 edition was
    developed by the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances of the National Conference
    on Weights and Measures (NCWM) with the assistance of the Office of Weights and
    Measures of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The handbook
    includes amendments adopted by the 100th Annual Meeting of the NCWM in 2015. NIST
    Handbook 44 is published in its entirety each year following the NCWM Annual Meeting.
