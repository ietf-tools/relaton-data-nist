abstract:
- content: Virus Particle Exposure in Residences (ViPER) is a web-based, single zone
    indoor air quality and ventilation analysis tool developed by the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) for evaluating an occupant's relative exposure
    to virus-laden particles exhaled by a temporary, contagious visitor inside a dwelling
    (i.e., subsequently referred to as the home). This tool is specifically designed
    for use in a residential environment. When an occupant (the home's resident) anticipates
    having a visitor (a potential, temporary and continuous source of virus-laden
    particles), this tool can be used to vary a set of input parameters and then compare
    the changes to either particle concentration or integrated exposure. Some such
    parameters include home size, visit duration, and portable air cleaner effectiveness,
    as well as mechanical ventilation rates and heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
    system operation strategies. This tool is based on a database of 1,296 CONTAM
    simulation results. CONTAM is a multizone indoor air quality and airflow analysis
    program developed by NIST. ViPER allows users to compare a base scenario meant
    to represent their home against multiple what-if scenarios meant to mitigate their
    exposure to virus-laden particles. ViPER is available, along with CONTAM and other
    NIST-developed software, on the NIST Multizone Modeling Website https://www.nist.gov/el/energy-and-environment-division-73200/nist-mult
