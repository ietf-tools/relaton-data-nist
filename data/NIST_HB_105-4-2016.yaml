abstract:
- content: These specifications and tolerances are recommended as minimum requirements
    for standards used by state and local weights and measures officials and others
    in the regulatory verification of meters used in quantity determination of pressurized
    liquid commodities. Other users may find this handbook helpful in the design of
    volumetric standards for measuring pressurized liquid commodities, but the requirements
    should not be considered mandatory for special applications outside the scope
    of regulatory weights and measures.
