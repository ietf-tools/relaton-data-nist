abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients
    Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat-soluble
    vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the
    design of and results for the Winter, Spring and Fall 1988 MMQAP measurement comparability
    improvement studies: 1) Round Robin XII Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in
    Human Serum, 2) Round Robin XIII FatSoluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human
    Serum, and 3) Round Robin XIV Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum.
    The materials for Round Robin XII were shipped to participants in January 1988;
    participants were requested to provide their measurement results by March 2, 1988.
    The materials for Round Robin XIII were shipped to participants in May 1988; participants
    were requested to provide their measurement results by July 1, 1988. The materials
    for Round Robin XIV were shipped to participants in August 1988; participants
    were requested to provide their measurement results by October 1, 1988.'
