abstract:
- content: This publication provides security and privacy control baselines for the
    Federal Government. There are three security control baselines (one for each system
    impact levelâ€”low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact), as well as a privacy
    baseline that is applied to systems irrespective of impact level. In addition
    to the control baselines, this publication provides tailoring guidance and a set
    of working assumptions that help guide and inform the control selection process.
    Finally, this publication provides guidance on the development of overlays to
    facilitate control baseline customization for specific communities of interest,
    technologies, and environments of operation.
