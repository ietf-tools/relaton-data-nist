abstract:
- content: The ASTM E3012 Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects
    of Manufacturing Processes provides guidelines for formally characterizing manufacturing
    processes. However, the difficulty that has arisen in the early use of the standard
    illustrates the need for intuitive tools for helping modeling experts to conform
    to the specified information model. The Unit Manufacturing Process (UMP) Builder
    was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
    provide a visual interface for helping modeling experts to conform to the specified
    ASTM information model. The UMP Builder, a browser-based tool, integrates symbolic
    mathematical and guided textual inputs, helping to consistently record manufacturing
    process models for environmental sustainability into a repository. The Builder
    also serves as a curator by providing capabilities to explore and visualize models
    recorded in the Builder repository. The UMP Builder is adapted from of an open
    source tool called the Configurable Data Curation System (CDCS) developed at NIST.
    The CDCS was originally developed to capture, share, and transform materials data,
    allowing users to upload an XML schema and create instances of that schema. In
    the UMP Builder, the schema used for creating the models is frozen. The schema
    follows the guidelines from the ASTM E3012 standard. The Builder also provides
    unique features that are specific in order to facilitate the modelling of UMPs.
    This user s guide aims to provide guidelines to use the UMP Builder. To obtain
    more information (especially on the architecture), please refer to the CDCS documentation.
