abstract:
- content: The DSQAP was launched, in collaboration with the NIH ODS, in 2007. The
    program was established to enable laboratories to improve the accuracy of measurements
    in samples for nutrients, marker compounds, toxic elements, and/or contaminants
    in dietary supplement ingredients and finished products. Exercise 1 was designed
    with 7 studies, offering the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in house
    techniques on a variety measurements. Studies included determinations of select
    toxic and nutritional elements, vitamins, contaminants, and proximates in kelp,
    polyphenol content in kelp and green tea, water-soluble vitamins in meal replacement
    drink formulations, and botanical marker compounds in dietary supplement ingredient
    materials and finished products. This report summarizes the results, describes
    observations, and provides technical recommendations for measurement improvements.
