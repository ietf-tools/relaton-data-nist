abstract:
- content: Wireless interference tests are often performed in shielded anechoic and
    semi-anechoic chambers near room temperature. The corresponding test condition
    experienced by a receiver DUT is antenna noise temperature equal to physical room
    temperature (barring EMI in the test zone). This technical note considers a simple
    analytical model for adjusting interference response from these room temperature
    tests for use in deployment antenna noise environments. The method we propose
    is focused toward applications in which the total receiver system noise is less
    sensitive to potential variability in antenna noise temperature than receiver
    noise performance (like noise figure and dissipative losses inside the antenna).
    Example applications include ground-based satellite receivers (for which antenna
    noise temperature is likely the averaged sky temperature) or cellular handsets
    (for which noise may originate primarily within the receiver electronics and antenna).
    As a case study, we analyze test results published in NIST Technical Note 1952.
    The DUTs under study are GPS L1 receivers exposed to antenna (sky) noise temperatures
    of 90 K to 340 K. For practical combinations of receiver noise figure and receive
    antenna efficiency performance, we develop an regression correction model that
    transforms interference power levels from the room temperature test environment
    into estimated equivalents in deployment. The regression is a function of antenna
    noise temperature, leaving receiver performance variability as a fit error. The
    worst-case error across the receiver performance parameter space was +/- 1.6 dB,
    which is tighter than the +/- 2.4 dB uncertainty in the measurement of interference
    power level.
