abstract:
- content: 'The 2018 Camp Fire in Butte County, California quickly impacted the communities
    of Concow, Paradise, and Magalia, triggering widespread evacuation of 40 000 people.
    The fire became the most deadly and destructive fire in California history, resulting
    in 85 fatalities and more than 18 000 destroyed structures. After a preliminary
    reconnaissance, it was determined that abundant data was available to support
    an in-depth case study of this devastating wildland-urban interface (WUI) fire,
    with the goal to learn and increase preparedness for future incidents. This portion
    of the greater case study focuses on the life safety aspects of the Camp Fire
    incident: notification, evacuation, traffic, temporary refuge areas, rescues,
    and fatalities (collectively, NETTRA). Over 2600 NETTRA observations and data
    points were integrated into a spatiotemporal database. Analysis of this data used
    the foundation of the previously reconstructed fire progression timeline to provide
    important context to the NETTRA components. Details and the timeline of requested
    evacuation notifications are presented with respect to fire progression. The evacuation
    timeline was assessed via traffic observations throughout the region. The rapid
    and widespread impact of fire on the communities complicated evacuation efforts
    due to high traffic volume, road closures due to fire and debris, and direct fire
    exposures to evacuating civilians in numerous burnover events. A total of 31 temporary
    refuge areas were implemented during the incident, involving more than 1200 civilians.
    Further, 198 specific evacuation assistance / rescue events were identified, involving
    at least 1000 civilians. The unique analysis and reconstruction of the NETTRA
    components of this WUI fire will help at-risk communities prepare for and respond
    to future incidents.'
