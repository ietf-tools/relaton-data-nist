abstract:
- content: The experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for the binaries relevant
    to the catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass have been collected and analyzed using
    the NIST-COSMO-SAC and NIST-modified UNIFAC models. The existing inconsistencies
    in the experimental data and the predicted values are discussed. For VLE with
    furan derivatives, PTxy data are normally reported, which are in good agreement
    with the predicted values. For phenolic compounds, the gas phase compositions
    are available for only 36 % of the points, most results originate from a few laboratories,
    and each system has been typically studied in a single laboratory. The binaries
    are identified where more experimental VLE data are required to evaluate quality
    of the existing experimental and predicted results.
