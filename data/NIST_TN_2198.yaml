abstract:
- content: This report documents an experimental program to investigate High Energy
    Arcing Fault (HEAF) phenomena. The experiments provide data to better characterize
    the arc to improve the prediction of arc energy emitted during a HEAF event. An
    open box allows for direct observation of the arc, jet, enclosure breach, material
    loss, and electrical properties. The experiments were performed at KEMA Labs located
    in Chalfont, Pennsylvania. The experimental design, setup, and execution were
    completed by staff from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the U.S.
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Sandia National Laboratories
    (SNL) and KEMA Labs. In addition, representatives from the Electric Power Research
    Institute (EPRI) observed some of the experimental setup and execution. The HEAF
    experiments were performed between August 22, 2019 and September 18, 2019 on near-identical
    51 cm (20 in) cubic metal boxes suspended from a Unistrut support structure. A
    three-phase arcing fault was initiated at the ends of the conductors oriented
    vertically and located at the center of the box. Either aluminum or copper was
    used for the conductors. The low voltage experiments used 1000 volts AC, while
    the medium voltage experiments used 6900 volts AC consistent with other recently
    completed experiments. Durations of the experiment ranged from 1 s to 5 s with
    fault currents ranging from 1 kA to 30 kA. Real-time electrical operating conditions,
    including voltage, current, and frequency, were measured during the experiments.
    Heat fluxes and incident energies were measured with plate thermometers, plate
    calorimeters, and slug calorimeters at various locations around the electrical
    enclosures. The experiments were documented with normal and high-speed videography,
    infrared imaging, and photography.
