abstract:
- content: Manufacturers and manufacturing research organizations make investments
    to advance efficiency and competitiveness. Understanding the return for previously
    made investments can guide both manufacturers and researchers in identifying future
    investments with a high return. This paper examines trends in data from U.S. Department
    of Energy Industry Assessment Centers, which make technical assessments to reduce
    waste at small and medium sized manufacturers, to facilitate identifying potentially
    high return investments for manufacturers and researchers. The results show that
    the net present value is disproportionally distributed among investments, where
    20 % of the investment categories represent 82 % of the net present value (i.e.,
    net benefits). For individual investments, 20 % of the cumulative investment cost
    accounts for 74 % of the net present value. Regression analysis identified those
    investments with a high return when controlling for a selection of factors. The
    results suggest that over time, the average Internal rate of return (IRR) decreases,
    larger firms tend to receive higher IRR, and some investment categories tend to
    have higher IRR than others. The highest IRR investments were related to bottleneck
    reduction, scheduling, and just-in-time inventory. The highest concentration of
    net present value was found in heat recovery with the second highest concentration
    being in cogeneration and the third highest in lighting. The most common high
    IRR investment type that was statistically significant in a regression analysis
    was related to heat recovery with the second relating to space conditioning and
    the third most common was related to cogeneration.
