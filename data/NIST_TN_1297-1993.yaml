abstract:
- content: Results of measurements and conclusions derived from them constitute much
    of the technical information produced by NIST. It is generally agreed that the
    usefulness of measurement results, and thus much of the information that we provide
    as an institution, is to a large extent determined by the quality of the statements
    of uncertainty that accompany them. For example, only if quantitative and thoroughly
    documented statements of uncertainty accompany the results of NIST calibrations
    can the users of our calibration services establish their level of traceability
    to the U.S. standards of measurement maintained at NIST.
