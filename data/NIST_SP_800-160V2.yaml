abstract:
- content: This publication is used in conjunction with ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, Systems
    and software engineering--Systems life cycle processes, NIST Special Publication
    800-160, Volume 1, Systems Security Engineering--Considerations for a Multidisciplinary
    Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems, and NIST Special Publication
    800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations--A
    System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy. It can be viewed as a handbook
    for achieving the identified cyber resiliency outcomes based on a systems engineering
    perspective on system life cycle processes in conjunction with risk management
    processes, allowing the experience and expertise of the organization to help determine
    what is correct for its purpose. Organizations can select, adapt, and use some
    or all of the cyber resiliency constructs (i.e., objectives, techniques, approaches,
    and design principles) described in this publication and apply the constructs
    to the technical, operational, and threat environments for which systems need
    to be engineered. The system life cycle processes and cyber resiliency constructs
    can be used for new systems, system upgrades, or repurposed systems; can be employed
    at any stage of the system life cycle; and can take advantage of any system or
    software development methodology including, for example, waterfall, spiral, or
    agile. The processes and associated cyber resiliency constructs can also be applied
    recursively, iteratively, concurrently, sequentially, or in parallel and to any
    system regardless of its size, complexity, purpose, scope, environment of operation,
    or special nature.
