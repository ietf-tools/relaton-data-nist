abstract:
- content: To gather more in-depth information about how disasters affect businesses,
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have launched a study of business disruption
    and recovery related to several natural disasters. This report outlines the survey
    instrument used as the basis for the research designed to be conducted in partnership
    between the NIST Applied Economics Office (AEO) and a place-based, interdisciplinary
    regional research team via the NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment
    (RISA) Program. This research protocol uses a mixed-method research approach to
    study businesses that were impacted by Hurricane Irma in 2017 and their long-term
    recovery process. The approach combines both quantitative and qualitative data
    collection methods using both in- person and telephone surveys to obtain business
    disruption and recovery information from business owners and managers.
