abstract:
- content: This report of analysis documents procedures used to obtain certified values
    and associated uncertainties of the density of iso-octane SRM 2214 over an extended
    range of temperatures and pressures. This SRM is certified over the temperature
    range 50 degrees C to 160 degrees C and pressure range of 0.1 MPa to 30 MPa; an
    interpolation model is provided to calculate the density within these ranges.
    This SRM has a density of 691.853 kg?m3 at t = 20 degrees C and p = 0.1 MPa. The
    certification measurements were carried out in a two-sinker magnetic-suspension
    densimeter. The SRM material is commercial, high-purity iso-octane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane,
    CAS 540-84-1). Measurements were made on both degassed material and material saturated
    with nitrogen, and an estimated correction surface (valid over the range 50 degrees
    C ? t ? 100 degrees C and 0.1 MPa ? p ? 20 MPa) gives the density difference between
    the nitrogen-saturated and degassed materials. A thorough analysis of the uncertainties
    is presented; this includes effects resulting from the experimental density determination,
    possible degradation of the sample due to time and exposure to high temperatures,
    dissolved air, uncertainties in the empirical density model, and the sample-to-sample
    variations in the SRM vials. Also considered is the effect of uncertainties in
    the users temperature and pressure measurements. This SRM is intended for the
    calibration of industrial densimeters.
