abstract:
- content: 'Thermal conductivity measurements at and near room temperature are presented
    as the basis for certified values of thermal conductivity for SRM 1450e, Fibrous
    Glass Board. The meas-urements have been conducted in accordance with a randomized
    full factorial experimental design with three variables (bulk density, mean temperature,
    and ambient pressure) using the NIST 500 mm guarded-hot-plate apparatus. The thermal
    conductivity of the SRM specimens was measured over a range of bulk densities
    from 110 kg?m-3 to 154 kg?m-3, mean tempera-tures from 280 K to 360 K, and ambient
    pressure of 60 kPa to 100 kPa. Uncertainties of the measurements, consistent in
    format with current international guidelines, have been prepared. Statistical
    analyses of the physical properties from the SRM are presented and include varia-tions
    between boards, as well as within board. Each unit of SRM 1450e is individually
    certified for bulk density, ?, and batch certified for thermal conductivity with
    the following equation: where ? is the predicted thermal conductivity (W?m-1?K-1),
    ? is the bulk density (kg?m-3), and Tm is the mean temperature (K) valid over
    the temperature range of 280 K to 360 K. Certi-fied values of ? are valid for
    barometric pressures from 60 kPa to sea-level pressure (101.325 kPa). There is
    no pressure dependence on the thermal conductivity included in the certifica-tion
    equation above because no statistically significant relationship between ? and
    pressure was determined over the limited range of 60 kPa to 100 kPa. The expanded
    uncertainty for ? values from the above equation is 1 % with a coverage factor
    of approximately k = 2.'
