abstract:
- content: An extensometer for use as a laboratory standard at temperatures up to
    3000 ¿̐¿F (1650 ¿̐¿C) was designed. This extensometer was to operate in normal
    atmosphere under static and transient mechanical and thermal conditions, including
    intense thermal radiation. A prototype system, extensometer and indicating unit,
    was constructed. Static tests at temperatures up to 1500 ¿̐¿F (815 ¿̐¿C) and dynamic
    tests to temperatures above 2500 ¿̐¿F (1390 ¿̐¿C) were conducted. The results
    of these tests show that the system has a range of at least 0.085 inch (2.2 mm),
    has a resolution of 10^-5 inch, is linear to within about 0.1 percent of range,
    and has a random error of about 2 x 10^-5 inch. The results indicate that the
    extensometer could probably be used at temperatures approaching 3000 ¿̐¿F (1650
    ¿̐¿C) although it was not tested under these conditions. The design of the extensometer
    and indicator, materials used, description of components, methods of fabrication
    and assembly, and testing procedures are given.
