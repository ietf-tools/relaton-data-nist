abstract:
- content: At the request of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary
    Supplements (ODS) and in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC), in 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    conducted the fourth Fatty Acid Quality Assurance Program (FAQAP) interlaboratory
    study of fatty acid (FA) concentrations in human serum. This 2017 FAQAP study
    included measurements of free FAs (extraction and measurement prior to acid/base
    hydrolysis) and total FAs (measurement after acid/base hydrolysis). Participants
    were requested to analyze SRM 1950 Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma as a control,
    three unknown sera, and a free fatty acid (FFA) solution. Participants measuring
    fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derivatives of FAs were asked to analyze a FAME
    solution. The results from this fourth exercise are reported along with a summary
    of the analytical methods used by the 14 participating laboratories.
