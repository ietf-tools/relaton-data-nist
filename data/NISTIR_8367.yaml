abstract:
- content: In this paper, we make the case that interpretability and explainability
    are distinct requirements for machine learning systems. To make this case, we
    provide an overview of the literature in experimental psychology pertaining to
    interpretation (especially of numerical stimuli) and comprehension. We find that
    interpretation refers to the ability to contextualize a model s output in a manner
    that relates it to the system s designed functional purpose, and the goals, values,
    and preferences of end users. In contrast, explanation refers to the ability to
    accurately describe the mechanism, or implementation, that led to an algorithm
    s output, often so that the algorithm can be improved in some way. Beyond these
    definitions, our review shows that humans differ from one another in systematic
    ways, that affect the extent to which they prefer to make decisions based on detailed
    explanations versus less precise interpretations. These individual differences,
    such as personality traits and skills, are associated with their abilities to
    derive meaningful interpretations from precise explanations of model output. This
    implies that system output should be tailored to different types of users.
