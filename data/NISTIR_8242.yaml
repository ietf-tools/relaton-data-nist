abstract:
- content: NIST conducted the 2017 Pilot Open Speech Analytic Technologies Evaluation
    (OpenSAT) Evaluation as the first in a new type of evaluation series. This new
    series is being designed to combine data domains and speech-analytic tasks including
    the public-safetycommunications domain. This report summarizes the set up and
    results of the Pilot. The report includes 1) anonymous, composite plots, 2) an
    analysis of systems output, and 3) the dataset challenges in the evaluation. The
    methods used in the Pilot OpenSAT Evaluation included speech-activity detection;
    keyword search; automatic, speech recognition; and, three data domains. Those
    domains were low-resource language, public-safety communications, and YouTube
    videos. For the speech-analytics task, participants in the evaluation could choose
    one or all of the methods and one or all of the data domains.
