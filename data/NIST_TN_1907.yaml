abstract:
- content: This report presents the formulation and application of a newly developed
    temperature-dependent material model for structural steels. First it presents
    a model for computing the stress-strain behavior of structural steel for conditions
    appropriate to fire. The model accounts for the change in yield strength with
    temperature, the change in the amount of post-yield strain hardening with both
    temperature and room-temperature yield strength, and the change in strength with
    increasing strain rate. Then, this NIST stress-strain model is used for predicting
    flexural buckling of steel columns subjected to elevated temperature. The main
    focus of this part of the study is to evaluate the applicability of the NIST model
    for predicting the behavior of steel gravity columns at elevated temperatures
    using the finite-element method. Besides the stress-strain behavior, another key
    issue in evaluating the response of structural systems to fire effects is the
    modeling of fracture, which is required to capture failure modes such as tear
    out in connection plates and bolt shear. Fracture can be simulated in explicit
    finite element analysis using element erosion, in which elements are removed from
    the analysis when specified failure criteria are satisfied. A finite element material
    modeling methodology is presented for structural steels and bolts at elevated
    temperatures that incorporates erosion-based modeling of fracture. The failure
    criterion was calibrated against high- temperature experimental data on elongation
    of tensile coupons at fracture, and its dependence on temperature and mesh size
    was investigated. Finally, these temperature-dependent material models for structural
    steel and bolts that incorporate erosion-based modeling of fracture were implemented
    to study the performance of steel moment frame assemblies at elevated temperatures.
