abstract:
- content: 'This report enumerates all possible costs of wildfire management and wildfire-related
    losses. It, further, compiles estimates or proposes methods for estimating the
    costs and losses identified. These estimates can be used for C+NVC modeling, and
    can also be used to produce an estimate of the economic burden of wildfire for
    the United States. The economic burden represents the impact wildfire has on the
    U.S. economy. Tracking the economic burden of wildfire could be used to assess
    return-on-investment into wildfire interventions. The economic burden is decomposed
    into: 1. intervention costs; 2. prevention/preparedness, mitigation, suppression,
    and cross-cutting; 2. and into direct and indirect wildfire related (net) losses.
    The annualized economic burden from wildfire is estimated to be between $71.1
    billion to $347.8 billion ($2016 US). Annualized costs are estimated to range
    from $7 .6 billion to $62.8 billion.'
