abstract:
- content: Type F20 resistance strain gages, manufactured by the Shinkoh Communications
    Industry Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan and sold in the United States by the Metrix
    Company, were evaluated at temperatures up to 400¿̐¿ F. The results of these tests
    indicate that the gage factor at 75¿̐¿ F is within 3 percent of the manufacturer's
    nominal value; that the gage factor at elevated temperatures varies considerably
    from gage to gage; that the gages are able to sustain strains of 0.004 without
    failure at temperatures as high as 300¿̐¿ F; that the drift is low at temperatures
    as high as 400¿̐¿ F; that the temperature sensitivity is repeatable; and that
    the resistance to ground is a function of the thermal history of the gage.
