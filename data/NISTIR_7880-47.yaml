abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates the Micronutrients
    Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories that measure fat-soluble
    vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This report describes the
    design of and results for the Winter and Summer 2016 MMQAP measurement comparability
    improvement studies: 1) Round Robin LXXIX Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids
    in Human Serum (RR79) and 2) Round Robin LXXX Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Carotenoids
    in Human Serum (RR80). The RR79 samples were shipped in early March 2016, with
    results due May 16, 2016. The RR80 samples were shipped in late June 2016, with
    results due September 12, 2016.'
