abstract:
- content: To strengthen America s resilience, the Federal Government recognizes a
    need to reduce interruptions to services and jobs, and to lessen disruption to
    social and economic community functions after earthquake events. Current building
    codes and standards largely focus on saving lives. However, maintaining services
    and functionality will require new mechanisms that more effectively limit damage
    to buildings and lifelines infrastructure systems. In response to a U.S. Congressional
    mandate, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Federal Emergency
    Management Administration1 convened a Committee of Experts to recommend and assess
    options for improving post-earthquake reoccupancy and functional recovery time
    across the built environment. To inform the Committee of Experts and assist in
    their development of a report to Congress, stakeholder workshops were held in
    five cities across the country to gather information from subject matter experts
    and professionals in the earthquake community. This document details the processes
    for gathering input from stakeholders at workshops. It summarizes participants
    reactions to functional recovery concepts and options, particularly with respect
    to information that can help determine appropriate recovery times, as well as
    criteria for assessing various implementation options. In particular, workshop
    participants provided insights regarding which community functions were viewed
    as critical to postearthquake recovery, and when components of the built environment
    that support those functions would need to recover in order to maintain community
    stability. Generally, participants categorized components of the built environment
    important in the short term (hours and days) more consistently than the components
    slated for return in longer timeframes (weeks and months). Participants noted
    the importance of local values and community contexts to these assignments. Attendees
    were also asked to consider what factors a policy maker could use to effectively
    assess and compare options to improve functional recovery. Cost, benefit, feasibility,
    effectiveness, and equity were the five categories of evaluative criteria identified
    most clearly and frequently across attendees. Overall, participants supported
    the idea of developing a national framework for functional recovery, while emphasizing
    the importance of flexibility and adaptability of the framework such that it can
    be utilized as a tool for planning at the local level. Additional key themes stakeholders
    identified as important for inclusion in the report to Congress are detailed in
    Section 5. Input from a diversity of stakeholder perspectives gathered at the
    workshops were essential to help develop the concept of functional recovery and
    inform the report to Congress. In the future, additional feedback will be needed
    to develop specific resilience goals, set public policy, and prioritize the investment
    of resources to produce functional recovery performance.
