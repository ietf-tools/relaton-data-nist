abstract:
- content: The spreading of powder is an integral part of powder bed fusion-based
    additive manufacturing technologies; however, due to the complex nature and the
    number of interactions between particles, studying the powder spreading process
    is difficult. In order to gain insight into how the metal powder is spread in
    the powder bed fusion machines using a recoater, a spreading testbed is needed,
    which provides a method for recording the powder spreading process and characterizing
    the powder spread layer. The objective of this testbed is to study and try to
    establish fundamental relationships between bulk metal powder characteristics
    and powder spreading performance. Here, a fabrication of a powder spreading testbed
    (PST) is described. The minimum but necessary functionality of the PST has been
    discussed. The potential characterization methods for the powder spread layer
    have been proposed. This document serves as a guideline for the future development
    of the present testbed.
