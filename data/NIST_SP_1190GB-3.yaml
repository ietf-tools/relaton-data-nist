abstract:
- content: Once a community identifies its resilience gaps, the challenge shifts to
    identifying solutions to close those gaps. One of the most helpful actions is
    to research and understand what other communities have done to accomplish their
    goals. This Guide Brief offers descriptions of and links to community resilience
    programs of leading U.S. communities that follow the process in the Guide or have
    common goals to those of the Guide. These examples may assist the community resilience
    planning team in developing practical solutions and implementation plans in Step
    4.
