abstract:
- content: The transfer characteristics (amplitude and phase as a function of frequency)
    of the sky wave propagated between the D-region and the E-region of the ionosphere
    and the earth have been evaluated at low and very low frequencies by the geometrical-optical
    theory employing the quasi-longitudinal approximation of the ionosphere reflection
    coefficients. Distances, d/j, up to 1000 statute miles are considered and multiple
    hops or time-modes (j = 1, 2, 3, ... ) are evaluated for a vertical electric dipole
    source. The effects of the electron density, collision frequency, intensity of
    the earth's magnetic field and the geometrical parameters are illustrated. The
    effect of the vertical lapse of the permittivity of the earth's atmosphere is
    introduced into the computation.
