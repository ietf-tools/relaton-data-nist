abstract:
- content: Verified and validated test methods, being necessary to measure the performance
    of complex systems, are important tools for driving innovation, benchmarking and
    improving performance, and establishing trust in collaborative human-robot teams.
    This full-day workshop aims to explore the metrology necessary for repeatably
    and independently assessing the collaborative performance of robotic systems in
    real-world human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. This workshop aims to bridge
    the gaps between the theory and applications of HRI in industry, accelerating
    the adoption of cutting edge technologies as the industry state-of-practice. The
    interest in collaborative HRI is evident in the current market as well as standards
    efforts toward manufacturing, social, medical, and service robot solutions. Though
    these domains have been considered separate for many years, recent technological
    and scientific advancements show that, while their applications may differ, the
    underlying principles of HRI performance impact each identically. As such, this
    workshop seeks to identify test methods and metrics for the holistic assessment
    and assurance of collaborative HRI performance. The focus is on identifying the
    key performance indicators of these seemingly disparate sectors, and additionally
    to establish a community based on the principles of transparency, repeatability,
    & establishing trust in the assessment of collaborative HRI. The goal is to aid
    in the advancement of HRI technologies through the development of experimental
    scenarios, protocols, test methods, & metrics for the verification and validation
    of interaction solutions and interface designs.
