abstract:
- content: 'Organizational security awareness programs may experience a number of
    challenges, including lack of funding and staff with the appropriate knowledge
    and skills to manage an effective program. While prior surveys and research have
    examined programs in the private sector, there is little understanding of whether
    these findings also apply within the U.S. government. To address this gap and
    better understand the needs, challenges, practices, and necessary competencies
    of federal security awareness teams and programs, NIST conducted a comprehensive,
    two-phase research study that leveraged both qualitative and quantitative methodologies.
    This companion document to NISTIR XXXX Federal Cybersecurity Awareness Programs:
    A Mixed Methods Research Study reports on a subset of study results focused on
    identifying the current job classifications, work roles, and desired knowledge
    and skills for security awareness professionals within the federal government.
    Insights gained from these results are informing guidance and other initiatives
    to aid federal organizations in building security awareness teams with the appropriate
    competencies. While focused on the U.S. government, findings may also have implications
    for organizational security awareness professionals in other sectors.'
