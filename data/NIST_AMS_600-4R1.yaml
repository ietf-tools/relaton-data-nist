abstract:
- content: Under the authority of the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation
    Act (RAMI) of 2014, the Secretary of Commerce established the Network for Manufacturing
    Innovation, generally called the Manufacturing USA network. The network, along
    with its manufacturing innovation institutes, makes up the Manufacturing USA program.
    This document is a revision of the original document published December 2016,
    and then later revised in October 2018, that chartered the Manufacturing USA network.
    The charter formalizes the functions of the Manufacturing USA network to facilitate
    intra-network collaboration, fulfilling the need for an internal information clearinghouse
    foster robust communication between the network and external stakeholders, serving
    as an external information clearinghouse for the program.
