abstract:
- content: 'ASTM subcommittee D22.05 on Indoor Air is working to finalize WK40293:
    Standard Test Method for Estimating Chemical Emissions from Spray Polyurethane
    Foam (SPF) Insulation Using Micro-Scale Environmental Test Chambers. One issue
    in WK40293 is determining the best method to accurately measure the temperature
    in the micro-chambers. Properly characterizing micro-chamber temperature is vital
    to get comparable emission data. Three methods to determining micro-chamber temperature
    with a thermocouple were investigated using two micro-chamber systems: 1) placing
    the thermocouple in the airspace of a micro-chamber, 2) taping the thermocouple
    to the bottom of the air filled micro-chamber, 3) placing the thermocouple in
    a micro-chamber filled 50 % to 75 % with water. The results show that air measurements
    are dependent upon the depth of the thermocouple placement, as both micro-chamber
    systems are stratified. Taping the thermocouple to the bottom of the micro-chamber
    resulted in average values that were similar to a water filled micro-chamber for
    one system but not the other. Data from both the air and tape methods had 1 [degrees]C
    to 2 [degrees]C temperature cycles in one of the systems, but not the other. The
    water method consistently resulted in temperature data with the smallest standard
    deviation. As a result of this research the authors propose new prescriptive and
    performance metric text for temperature measurement requirements in ASTM WK40293.'
