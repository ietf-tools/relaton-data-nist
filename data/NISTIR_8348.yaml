abstract:
- content: 'the 2020 National Institute of Standards and Technology Environmental
    Scan provides an analysis of key external factors that could impact NIST and the
    fulfillment of its mission in coming years. The analyses were conducted through
    four separate lenses: Societal, Investment & Geopolitical, Political & Policy,
    and Technology & Science. Most of the issues discussed in the initial environmental
    scan conducted in 2018 are still relevant, but a number of key issues have emerged
    in society that will impact NIST since the writing of that report, most notably
    the COVID-19 pandemic and the national discourse around race. Societal, political,
    financial, and workforce issues will challenge NIST to maintain and advance its
    leadership in metrology, standards, and technology. However, a broad range of
    emerging technology issues present opportunities for NIST to have significant
    impact in advancing the nationâ€™s innovation and industrial competitiveness.'
