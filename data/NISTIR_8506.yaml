abstract:
- content: This report serves to determine how Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple
    Access (OFDMA) is triggered in commercial IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) access points
    for industrial application scenarios. It presents an overview of OFDMA and how
    it works in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6). Then, it provides the measurement methodologies
    for determining OFDMA triggering conditions by performing experiments that vary
    the traffic, number of wireless stations, and transmitted packet lengths. A wireless
    sniffer is used to determine when OFDMA trigger frames are sent, indicating OFDMA
    activation. The resulting table shows what set of conditions activate OFDMA in
    the test environment. Of the two commercial access points tested in this report,
    both are observed to follow the same condition for OFDMA activation, namely when
    two or more stations send over 100 packets per second, regardless of packet size.
    Another contribution is a method to determine when OFDMA is activated using an
    industrial computer, configured as a wireless sniffer.
