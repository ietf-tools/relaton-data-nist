abstract:
- content: This report explores the use of electronic pollbooks (e-pollbooks) in elections.
    The scope of this report is on usability and accessibility of e-pollbooks, that
    is, their use by poll workers and voters, rather than on technical features or
    costs. This document reports on the use of e-pollbooks in the U.S.; their software,
    hardware, and interface design, usability, and evaluation. Also presented are
    the processes in which e-pollbooks are used and state laws encouraging or prohibiting
    their use. Research described in this report was conducted in 2017. The use of
    e-pollbooks presented throughout the document reflects the state of elections
    in 2017. In the time since this research was performed, e-pollbooks have made
    progress addressing usability and accessibility issues. Additionally, as part
    of its ongoing Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP) program,
    the Election Assistance Commission developed the Voluntary Electronic Poll Book
    Requirements (VEPBR) in collaboration with NIST. This publication is intended
    to provide a deep dive into how to evaluate the usability and accessibility of
    e-pollbooks in order to meet the relevant VEPBR user-centered design process and
    usability testing requirements as well as any state certifications pertaining
    to usability and accessibility.
