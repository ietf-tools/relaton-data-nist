abstract:
- content: Computer-interpretable representations of system structure and behavior
    are at the center of developing todayâ€™s complex systems. Systems engineers create
    and review these representations using graphical languages and information models
    that capture requirements, designs, and tests (such as the Systems Modeling Language,
    SysML). The SysML Extension for Physical Interaction and Signal Flow Simulation
    (SysPhS) is a standard for augmenting SysML models with one-dimensional (lumped
    parameter) simulation information and translating them to widely-used simulation
    platforms for testing, without respecifying the system on those platforms. It
    includes standard reusable models of system components (libraries) corresponding
    and translated to those in common between the platforms. This report presents
    additional physical interaction component libraries, covering areas not currently
    standardized. It applies the libraries to some manufacturing examples, translates
    them to the simulation platforms, and verifies that they give the same results
    across platforms.
