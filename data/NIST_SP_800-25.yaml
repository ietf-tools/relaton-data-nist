abstract:
- content: This document builds on the Federal IT Security Assessment Framework (Framework)
    developed by NIST for the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council. The
    Framework established the groundwork for standardizing on five levels of security
    status and criteria agencies could use to determine if the five levels were adequately
    implemented. This document provides guidance on applying the Framework by identifying
    17 control areas, such as those pertaining to identification and authentication
    and contingency planning. In addition, the guide provides control objectives and
    techniques that can be measured for each area.
