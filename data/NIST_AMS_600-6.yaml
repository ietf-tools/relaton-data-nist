abstract:
- content: Manufacturing USA is a network of public-private partnerships united to
    secure U.S. global leadership in advanced manufacturing through large scale collaboration
    on technology, supply chain, and workforce development. The network includes the
    U.S. Departments of Commerce (DOC), Defense (DoD), and Energy (DOE), their sponsored
    manufacturing institutes and six other federal partner agencies - NASA, NSF, HHS,
    and the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Labor. Together, they work towards
    accomplishing national manufacturing objectives to secure America's future through
    manufacturing innovation, education, and collaboration. This report provides a
    summary of the technology innovation and workforce development projects involving
    the institutes and their 1,900 member organizations.
