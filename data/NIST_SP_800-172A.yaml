abstract:
- content: 'The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal
    systems and organizations is important to federal agencies and can directly impact
    the ability of the Federal Government to successfully carry out its assigned missions
    and business operations. This publication provides federal agencies and nonfederal
    organizations with assessment procedures that can be used to carry out assessments
    of the requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-172, Enhanced Security Requirements
    for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information: A Supplement to NIST Special
    Publication 800-171. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be tailored
    to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be conducted as 1)
    self-assessments; 2) independent, third-party assessments; or 3) government-sponsored
    assessments. The assessments can be conducted with varying degrees of rigor based
    on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes. The findings and evidence produced
    during the assessments can be used to facilitate risk-based decisions by organizations
    related to the CUI enhanced security requirements.'
