abstract:
- content: The production and demand for hand sanitizers have increased dramatically
    during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health emergency. To be deemed
    effective and safe, hand sanitizers should contain at least 60 % alcohol (typically
    ethanol) as well as minimal amounts of harmful impurities regulated by the Food
    and Drug Administration (FDA). To help ensure product potency and safety through
    sound measurements, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    developed and evaluated four instrumental measurement approaches for their applicability
    in measuring ethanol and impurities in 72 hand sanitizers representing a range
    of brands and formulations. The methods included gas chromatography with flame
    ionization detection (GC-FID), liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance
    detection (LC-UV), quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (qNMR),
    and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR).
    All four instrumental methods can determine and provide comparable results for
    ethanol, the principle disinfectant in different hand sanitizer formulations.
    All methods can also confirm the presence of other alcohols potentially present
    in significant quantities (? percent levels) such as methanol, a harmful impurity,
    and isopropanol, which can be either the primary disinfectant or an approved denaturant
    in some formulations. Two of the methods, qNMR and GC-FID, were also able to determine
    impurities at the requisite sensitivity levels ( g/g) set by the FDA limits. This
    report presents descriptions and key results from each method. In addition, a
    discussion regarding the applicability and strengths and weaknesses of each measurement
    approach for the analysis of hand sanitizers is presented and discussed.
