abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 44 includes specifications, tolerances, and other technical
    requirements for weighing and measuring devices. These requirements are intended
    to encourage the design, installation, testing, and use of weighing and measuring
    devices that provide for accurate, repeatable measurements; facilitate clear and
    transparent transactions for buyer and seller; and do not facilitate fraud. NIST
    Handbook 44 is adopted by many state, local, and some federal weights and measures
    authorities to apply to commercial weighing and measuring equipment and associated
    equipment and for use in applications for law enforcement and the collection of
    statistical information by government agencies. NIST has a statutory responsibility
    for “cooperation with the states in securing uniformity of weights and measures
    laws and methods of inspection” and publishes this and other NIST Handbooks in
    partial fulfillment of this responsibility. NIST Handbook 44 was first published
    in 1949, having been preceded by similar handbooks of various designations and
    in several forms, beginning in 1918; the handbook is now typically published on
    an annual basis. This 2023 edition includes amendments made through the Committee
    on Specifications and Tolerances of the National Conference on Weights and Measures
    (NCWM) with technical guidance from the Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) of
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and input from weights
    and measures officials and industry representatives. These amendments were adopted
    by the NCWM at its 107th Annual Meeting in July 2022.
