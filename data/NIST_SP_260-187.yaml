abstract:
- content: 'Rheological measurements are often performed using a rotational rheometer.
    In this type of rheometer, the tested fluid is sheared between two surfaces, one
    of which acts as the rotating surface [1]. Usually, the rotational velocity is
    imposed and the response of the material is monitored by the measurement of the
    torque. Typically, manufacturers of rheometers recommend using a standard oil
    of known viscosity to verify that the instrument is operating correctly. However,
    these oils are expensive, and they cannot be used for the large volumes employed
    in concrete rheometers. Furthermore, the oils do not contain aggregates and may
    not offer a valid representation of concrete since concrete is a suspension with
    solid particulates and display non-Newtonian behavior. Therefore, a relatively
    inexpensive, accurate standard reference material (SRM) for concrete rheometers
    is needed. The development of this new SRM is based on a multiphase approach:
    (1) the first phase established the SRM 2492 for cementitious paste mixtures [2],
    (2) the second phase developed and certified the mortar phase SRM 2493, and (3)
    the completion of an SRM 2497 for concrete mixtures will mark the third stage.
    This third stage is currently in progress. The purpose of this report is to describe
    the process used to certify SRM 2493, a Standard Reference Mortar for Rheological
    Measurements. The results of the rheological testing used to determine the rheological
    characteristics of SRM 2493 are discussed, along with the corresponding statistical
    analyses that was conducted to certify that the proposed models and reference
    values are valid'
