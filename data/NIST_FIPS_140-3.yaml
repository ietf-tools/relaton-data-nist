abstract:
- content: The selective application of technological and related procedural safeguards
    is an important responsibility of every federal organization in providing adequate
    security in its computer and telecommunication systems. This standard is applicable
    to all federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security systems to provide
    adequate information security for all agency operations and assets as defined
    in 15 U.S.C. ยง 278g-3. This standard shall be used in designing and implementing
    cryptographic modules that federal departments and agencies operate or are operated
    for them under contract. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels
    of security intended to cover a wide range of potential applications and environments.
    The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design, implementation
    and operation of a cryptographic module. These areas include cryptographic module
    specification; cryptographic module interfaces; roles, services, and authentication;
    software/firmware security; operating environment; physical security; non-invasive
    security; sensitive security parameter management; self-tests; life-cycle assurance;
    and mitigation of other attacks.
