abstract:
- content: This document provides a new Incident Handling framework dedicated to Operational
    Technology. This framework expands the traditional technical steps by giving an
    Incident Response procedure based on the event escalation and provides techniques
    for OT Digital Forensics. It includes an overview with general terms explanation
    and a list of unique properties of OT DFIR, the preparation that should be done
    to establish an OT Incident Response Team, and finally, the suggested OT Incident
    Handling framework in detail.
