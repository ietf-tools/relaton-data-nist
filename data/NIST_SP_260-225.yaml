abstract:
- content: Reference Material (RM) 8376 is intended for NGS-based measurements quantitative
    to the chromosome. A unit of RM 8376 consists of 20 components (A-T, 19 bacteria
    and 1 human) each containing well-characterized DNA in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L
    EDTA pH 8 buffer. Each component consists of one skirted 0.5-mL tube containing
    approximately 100 uL of DNA solution. Each tube is labeled and sealed with a removable
    screwcap. Here, we have documented the production, analytical methods, and statistical
    evaluation of realizing this RM.
