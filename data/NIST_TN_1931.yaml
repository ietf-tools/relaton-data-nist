abstract:
- content: This report presents a design for a novel test apparatus to directly measure
    the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). The design of the apparatus was focused primarily
    on being able to measure the MCE with minimized uncertainties for test samples
    of 5 g. The effort is meant to aid U.S. industry in selecting new, limited-quantity
    magnetocaloric (MC) materials for commercial development. A different measurement
    approach is also required because of the small test sample size and because of
    the wide disagreement in the validity of some indirect measurement techniques.
    These concerns require an accurate and direct measure of MCE in order to develop
    superior room temperature magnetocaloric materials. For the test apparatus design
    presented here, the estimated uncertainties for the adiabatic temperature change
    and the increased internal energy are 0.3 K and 0.6 % of the measurement, respectively.
    The small uncertainties were achieved for the small sample by leveraging the incompressibility
    of liquid as an amplifier to increase the sensitivity of energy measurement. Drawings,
    parts list, and required test equipment were specified for the construction of
    the test apparatus. A calibration technique using a first law of thermodynamics
    approach was outlined.
