abstract:
- content: A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a group of wireless networking
    devices within a limited geographic area, such as an office building, that exchange
    data through radio communications. The security of each WLAN is heavily dependent
    on how well each WLAN component⁰₄including client devices, access points (AP),
    and wireless switches⁰₄is secured throughout the WLAN lifecycle, from initial
    WLAN design and deployment through ongoing maintenance and monitoring. The purpose
    of this publication is to help organizations improve their WLAN security by providing
    recommendations for WLAN security configuration and monitoring. This publication
    supplements other NIST publications by consolidating and strengthening their key
    recommendations.
