abstract:
- content: Assurance of measurement quality to meet requirements for regulatory agencies,
    marketplace equity, and productivity and quality control in manufacturing and
    research is challenged by unprecedented demands for sensitivity, speed, precision,
    and accuracy over wide ranges of properties and signal characteristics. New approaches
    are needed. Examples of NBS response, principally in electrical and electronic
    engineering are described.
