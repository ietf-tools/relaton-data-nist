abstract:
- content: Enterprise patch management is the process of identifying, prioritizing,
    acquiring, installing, and verifying the installation of patches, updates, and
    upgrades throughout an organization. Patching is more important than ever because
    of the increasing reliance on technology, but there is often a divide between
    business/mission owners and security/technology management about the value of
    patching. This publication frames patching as a critical component of preventive
    maintenance for computing technologies a cost of doing business, and a necessary
    part of what organizations need to do in order to achieve their missions. This
    publication also discusses common factors that affect enterprise patch management
    and recommends creating an enterprise strategy to simplify and operationalize
    patching while also improving reduction of risk. Preventive maintenance through
    enterprise patch management helps prevent compromises, data breaches, operational
    disruptions, and other adverse events.
