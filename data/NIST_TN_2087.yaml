abstract:
- content: 'Inspired by our experiments on the effects of mockup configuration, used
    to assess and regulate smoldering propensity in residential upholstered furniture
    (RUF), a novel 2-D computational model is developed to predict the smoldering
    behavior in different mockups. In this model, two pieces of flexible polyurethane
    foams are placed perpendicularly to each other, one vertically and one horizontally.
    Smoldering modes in two mockup configurations have been modeled: the standard
    mockup (SM, where the foam is in direct contact with the frame) and modified mockup
    (MM, where an air gap is added between the foam and frame). In the SM, the first
    smoldering wave (controlled by foam pyrolysis and foam oxidation) spreads upward
    and downward slowly. Once the first wave approaches the top surface, the second
    smoldering wave is generated near the top surface and then is driven downward
    faster by char oxidation. The oxygen diffusion from the top surface controls the
    smoldering spread in the SM. In the MM, the open boundaries at bottom increase
    the buoyant force that drives more oxygen to the smoldering front, in which the
    convective mass flux from the bottom contributes a greater part. With the increase
    in foam thickness, the difference of the mass loss between the SM and MM is narrowed.
    It means that the thinner the foam, the more significant of the effects of buoyancy
    change by mockup design are. The model reproduced the experimental results and
    gives the detailed interpretations for the enhanced smoldering propensity in MM
    from the point of view of oxygen supply. The predicted results can provide guidelines
    for the selection of a proper smoldering scenario for better regulating smoldering
    propensity in bench-scale tests.'
