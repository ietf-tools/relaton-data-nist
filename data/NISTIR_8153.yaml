abstract:
- content: There is ongoing activity within ASTM E57.02 working group WK43218 [1]
    to develop a documentary standard for point-to-point distance performance evaluation
    of 3D imaging systems. The Dimensional Metrology Group (DMG) at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established facilities to realize all of
    the test procedures in the current draft. Part 1 [2] of this two-part report presented
    background information and key findings from an instrument runoff hosted by the
    DMG in support of this effort. This report (Part 2) describes test facilities
    established by the DMG, calibration procedures, validation data, and uncertainty
    budgets.
