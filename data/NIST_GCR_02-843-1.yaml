abstract:
- content: 'The study was commissioned to analyze the needs and existing capabiliites
    for full-scale fire resistance testing of structural connections. The scope of
    work consisted of three separate tasks. Task 1. Identification of building collapse
    incidents: The objective of this Task was to conduct a survey of historical information
    of fire occurences in multi-story (defined as four or more stories) buildings,
    which resulted in structural collapse. Either partial or total failure of the
    structural framing members, and/or connections was considered to hav constituted
    a collapse. Task 2. Survey of fire resistence test facilities: The objective of
    this task was to survey private and public facilities (for-profit, not-for-profit;
    academic, local, state and federal government; military and civilian; domestic
    and international) capable of testing structural integrity of building elements
    under fire conditions to establish the current global research capabilities in
    structural fire protection. Task 3. Needs assessment: the objective of this task
    was to perform an assessment of the need for additional testing and/or experimental
    facilities to support the development of predictive structural fire protection
    methods within actual buildings; and if a need does exist, options for meeting
    those needs.'
