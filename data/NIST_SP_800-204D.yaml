abstract:
- content: The predominant application architecture for cloud-native applications
    consists of multiple microservices, accompanied in some instances by a centralized
    application infrastructure, such as a service mesh, that provides all application
    services. This class of applications is generally developed using a flexible and
    agile software development paradigm called DevSecOps. A salient feature of this
    paradigm is the use of flow processes called continuous integration and continuous
    deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, which initially take the software through various
    stages (e.g., build, test, package, and deploy) in the form of source code through
    operations that constitute the software supply chain (SSC) in order to deliver
    a new version of software. This document outlines strategies for integrating SSC
    security measures into CI/CD pipelines.
