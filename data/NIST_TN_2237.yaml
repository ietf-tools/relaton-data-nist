abstract:
- content: This report documents collection methods for radio frequency in-phase/quadrature
    (I/Q) recordings of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth emissions in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz unlicensed
    bands using low-cost software defined radios. The aim of this effort was to acquire
    datasets that could be used to aid the development of computational models for
    emissions from real-world communication hardware. The complete datasets are publicly
    available at https://doi.org/10.18434/mds2-2731.
