abstract:
- content: A series of fourteen experiments on six 9 ft. 12 ft. (2.7 m 3.7 m) shear
    wall specimens consisting of cold-formed steel framing sheathed on one side with
    light-gauge steel adhered to gypsum board and on the opposite side with plain
    gypsum board were conducted at the National Fire Research Laboratory at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology. The specimens were subjected to varying
    sequences of simulated seismic shear deformation and fire loading to study the
    influence of structure-fire interactions on the lateral load capacity of the walls.
    The test program was designed to complement a parallel test series to investigate
    a full-scale six-story building subjected to earthquakes and fires. The test results
    showed that the fire loading caused a shift in the failure mode of the walls from
    local to global bucking of the sheet metal with an accompanying 35 % reduction
    of load capacity.
