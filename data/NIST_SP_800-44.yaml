abstract:
- content: 'Web servers maintained for public use are normally the most targeted and
    attacked hosts on an organization''s network. Thus, it is essential to secure
    Web servers and the network infrastructure that supports them. This document has
    been developed to assist federal departments and agencies, state agencies, and
    commercial organizations in installing, configuring, and maintaining secure public
    Web servers. It presents generic security principles and covers details specific
    to the various components of Web content, Web applications, and Web servers. It
    also includes examples that address two of the more popular Web server applications
    running respectively on Unix and Microsoft Windows operating systems: Apache and
    Internet Information Server.'
