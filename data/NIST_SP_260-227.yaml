abstract:
- content: A batch of 94 silicon chips containing arrays of uniform rectangular cantilevers
    were microfabricated from a single silicon wafer and their stiffnesses and resonance
    frequencies calibrated using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The cantilevers
    are 50 m wide, (about the width of a human hair), and vary in length from 600
    m to 300 m. They have stiffness values nominally ranging from 0.03 N/m to 0.2
    N/m and nominal first flexural resonance frequencies in the range of 5 kHz to
    21 kHz respectively. The LDV cantilever stiffness calibration measurements proved
    very reliable and combined expanded uncertainties better than 3% in stiffness
    were obtained for individual devices. These devices can be used as reference artifacts
    to validate atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever stiffness measurement methods
    as well as directly calibrating AFM test cantilever stiffness using the reference
    cantilever method. This NIST SP-260 provides details on the source and preparation
    of the devices as well as the analytical approach of using a laser Doppler vibrometer
    to accurately measure both stiffness (k), resonance frequency (f0), and Quality
    factor (Q) of each cantilever. The statistical analysis applied to the data sets
    is described. An example of the reference cantilever method is also provided for
    individuals wishing to use these devices to make direct calibrations of AFM test
    cantilevers.
