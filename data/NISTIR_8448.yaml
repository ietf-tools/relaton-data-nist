abstract:
- content: The Health Assessment Measurements Quality Assurance Program (HAMQAP) was
    launched in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office
    of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2017. HAMQAP was established to enable laboratories
    to improve the accuracy of measurements in samples that represent human intake
    (e.g., foods, dietary supplements, tobacco) and samples that represent human metabolism
    (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, urine) for demonstration of proficiency and/or compliance
    with various regulations. Analytes are paired where possible to represent the
    full spectrum of health assessment. Exercise 6 of this program offered the opportunity
    for laboratories to assess their in house measurements of nutritional elements
    (chlorine, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, and selenium), toxic elements (arsenic,
    cadmium, lead, and mercury), contaminants (chlorate and perchlorate, glyphosate
    and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA)), water-soluble vitamins (biotin and vitamin
    C), fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A and E), fatty acids (select omega-3 and omega-6
    fatty acids), botanicals (anthocyanidins), natural products (caffeine, theobromine,
    and theophylline), and proximates (fat, protein, carbohydrates, solids, ash, and
    calories) in foods and dietary supplements, and corresponding biomarkers/metabolites
    in clinical specimens (human red blood cells).
