abstract:
- content: Overall uncertainties are evaluated for the certification of transmittance
    density (absorbance referred to air) and regular spectral transmittance for solid
    neutral density filter Standard Reference Materials by means of a transfer spectrophotometer.
    Traceability is asserted by means of comparison measurements to a recognized reference
    spectrophotometer. The uncertainties are evaluated without bias correction, using
    the combination of the legacy combined standard uncertainty values with uncertainty
    components for the measured bias, the standard uncertainty of this measured bias,
    and the standard uncertainty characteristic of simple replication for a single
    measurement using the transfer spectrophotometer. Numerical results are given,
    and are anticipated to be the values initially quoted on certificates and in reports
    of recertification. However, these values are subject to change upon future adjustment
    of estimated uncertainty components for the filters or changes in the observed
    bias with future determinations.
