abstract:
- content: Cryptography is an essential component of modern computing. Unfortunately,
    implementing cryptography correctly is a non-trivial undertaking. Past research
    studies have supported this observation by revealing a multitude of errors and
    pitfalls in the cryptographic implementations of software products. However, the
    emphasis of these studies was on the practices of less-experienced, individual
    developers. Therefore, there is little understanding of the cryptographic development
    practices of organizations, including the benefits and challenges of using cryptographic
    resources such as standards specifications and libraries. To address this gap,
    a research team led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    Information Technology Laboratory Visualization and Usability Group conducted
    a qualitative investigation into the processes and resources that organizations
    employ in the development and testing of cryptographic products. The study involved
    21 in-depth interviews of 29 participants representing organizations that develop
    either a security product that uses cryptography or a non-security product that
    heavily relies on cryptography. This report categorizes and enumerates a subset
    of findings that document participant comments specific to NIST cryptographic
    publications and testing/validation programs, with a goal of informing future
    decisions of NIST and other standards bodies working in this space.
