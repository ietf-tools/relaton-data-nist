abstract:
- content: Polymer coatings containing nanofillers (such as alumina, titania, silica,
    zinc oxide, etc.) are increasingly, or potentially will be, used in construction,
    aerospace, automobile, electronics, and many other coating-related industries.
    These nanocoatings are often exposed to severe mechanical and environmental stresses
    during a polymer nanocoating's life cycle. As time passes and the polymer degrades,
    the nanofillers migrate to the surface of the nanocoating and can be released
    into the environment. This SP emphasizes the assessment and measurement of nanosilica
    release from weathered epoxy nanocoatings. This protocol can be applied to other
    nanocoatings or nanocomposite systems. Updates to this protocol may be released
    in the future. Visit https://www.nist.gov/mml/nano-measurement-protocols for revisions
    of this protocol or for new protocols in the series. Users are encouraged to reference
    the protocol in their publications.
