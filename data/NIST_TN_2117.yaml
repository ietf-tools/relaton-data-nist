abstract:
- content: 'In the United States, preparing for the impacts of natural hazards is
    primarily the responsibility of communities and local governments. Increasingly,
    while communities address these hazard mitigation responsibilities, they are concurrently
    undertaking emerging planning processes that address objectives such as resilience,
    adaptation, and sustainability. These planning objectives require a process that
    may be technically and administratively complicated, often requiring the incorporation
    of emerging scientific information and decision making under uncertainty. The
    growth of these planning documents in practice and a field of scholarly work assessing
    the quality of these planning documents provides an opportunity to better understand
    how to increase the quality of these planning processes. This annotated bibliography
    was assembled to achieve two objectives: (1) to provide a review of scholarly
    literature assessing or evaluating community or local scale planning for objectives
    related to resilience, adaptation, and sustainability, and (2) to inform the future
    development of an analytical methodology to assess the content of resilience,
    adaptation, and sustainability planning guidance, instructions, and requirements
    for practice. A discussion of the review findings addresses the second objective
    by presenting a set of plan quality principles that can be used for future plan
    and associated material assessment. The discussion also highlights concepts observed
    related to resilience, adaptation, and sustainability terminology, and findings
    from the review related to the state of practice and research on resilience, adaptation,
    and sustainability planning. Future areas of work to advance research capabilities
    related to plan quality assessment are also presented.'
