abstract:
- content: Blockchains are tamper evident and tamper resistant digital ledgers implemented
    in a distributed fashion (i.e., without a central repository) and usually without
    a central authority (i.e., a bank, company, or government). At their basic level,
    they enable a community of users to record transactions in a shared ledger within
    that community, such that under normal operation of the blockchain network no
    transaction can be changed once published. This document provides a high-level
    technical overview of blockchain technology. The purpose is to help readers understand
    how blockchain technology works.
