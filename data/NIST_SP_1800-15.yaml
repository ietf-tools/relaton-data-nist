abstract:
- content: The goal of the Internet Engineering Task Force's Manufacturer Usage Description
    (MUD) specification is for Internet of Things (IoT) devices to behave as intended
    by the manufacturers of the devices. MUD provides a standard way for manufacturers
    to indicate the network communications that a device requires to perform its intended
    function. When MUD is used, the network will automatically permit the IoT device
    to send and receive only the traffic it requires to perform as intended, and the
    network will prohibit all other communication with the device, thereby increasing
    the device's resilience to network based attacks. In this project, the NCCoE demonstrated
    the ability to ensure that when an IoT device connects to a home or small-business
    network, MUD can automatically permit the device to send and receive only the
    traffic it requires to perform its intended function. This NIST Cybersecurity
    Practice Guide explains how MUD protocols and tools can reduce the vulnerability
    of IoT devices to botnets and other network-based threats as well as reduce the
    potential for harm from exploited IoT devices. It also shows IoT device developers
    and manufacturers, network equipment developers and manufacturers, and service
    providers who employ MUD-capable components how to integrate and use MUD to satisfy
    IoT users' security requirements.
