abstract:
- content: The first Government Data De-Identification Stakeholders Meeting was held
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology on June 29, 2016. This meeting
    featured 80 participants from 67 different government agencies. Following the
    keynote, five panels discussed agency case studies, agency needs, available solutions,
    governance, and evaluation of de-identification techniques. Eighteen presenters
    from eleven agencies spoke for 10-minutes each. After each speaker's presentation,
    audience members asked questions and elaborated on points that the speakers made.
    Overall, it was the sense of the attendees that there is a need for collaboration
    and the sharing of techniques for the de-identification of government data.
