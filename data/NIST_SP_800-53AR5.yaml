abstract:
- content: This publication provides a methodology and set of procedures for conducting
    assessments of security and privacy controls employed within systems and organizations
    within an effective risk management framework. The assessment procedures, executed
    at various phases of the system development life cycle, are consistent with the
    security and privacy controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 5.
    The procedures are customizable and can be easily tailored to provide organizations
    with the needed flexibility to conduct security and privacy control assessments
    that support organizational risk management processes and are aligned with the
    stated risk tolerance of the organization. Information on building effective security
    and privacy assessment plans is also provided with guidance on analyzing assessment
    results.
