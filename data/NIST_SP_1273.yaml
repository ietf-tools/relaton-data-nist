abstract:
- content: As stated in Executive Order (EO) 14019, Promoting Access to Voting,1 149
    the right to vote is the foundation of American democracy. The EO further recognizes
    that “People with disabilities continue to face barriers to voting and are denied
    legally required accommodations in exercising their fundamental rights and the
    ability to vote privately and independently.” This NIST Special Publication is
    intended to contribute to the efforts of improving accessibility for voters by
    making recommendations that may help to remove barriers impeding the ability for
    people with disabilities to vote privately and independently.
