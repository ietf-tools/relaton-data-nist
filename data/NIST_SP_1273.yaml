abstract:
- content: 'As stated in Executive Order (EO) 14019, Promoting Access to Voting, the
    right to vote is the foundation of American democracy. The EO further recognizes
    that People with disabilities continue to face barriers to voting and are denied
    legally required accommodations in exercising their fundamental rights and the
    ability to vote privately and independently. NIST produced this NIST Special Publication
    in response to its responsibilities described in Section 7 of the EO. NIST was
    specifically tasked to: 1. Evaluate the steps needed to ensure that the online
    National Mail Voter Registration Form is accessible to people with disabilities,
    and 2. Identify barriers and publish recommendations to remove barriers preventing
    individuals with disabilities from voting. Five systemic barriers voters with
    disabilities face throughout the voting process for privately and independently
    voting are identified. Recommended actions to overcome these barriers and promote
    access to voting for voters with disabilities are described. In many cases, existing
    best practices and guidance are recommended to be broadly applied to voting systems
    and processes across the country. This publication also presents recommendations
    to address barriers identified in specific aspects of the voting process that
    includes voter registration and the National Mail Voter Registration Form, vote-by-mail,
    using voting technology for in-person voting, voting at polling locations, and
    training and documentation for poll workers.'
