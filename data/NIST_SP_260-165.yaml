abstract:
- content: This document describes the physical characteristics of Standard Reference
    Material SRM 5000, provides guidance for its use in calibrating overlay (OL) tools,
    and gives information and precautions concerning its care and handling. Standard
    Reference Material SRM 5000 was developed for use in calibrating OL tools. It
    is a double-etched silicon on silicon 200 mm wafer with various OL targets. Five
    Frame-in-Frame targets and five Bar-in-Bar targets on this wafer were calibrated.
    This SRM makes possible traceable OL measurements in a customer s facility in
    effect by comparisons of measurements on this wafer to the certified values provided
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).A layout of the wafer
    is presented to guide the user to the locations that contain the calibrated OL
    targets. A discussion on calibration strategies is included to help the user decide
    on the best way to use the SRM 5000. The NIST OL tool and certification technique
    are described. The statistical performance of the system was evaluated by monitoring
    values from a control wafer. The factors which contribute to the calibration uncertainty
    are explained and evaluated.
