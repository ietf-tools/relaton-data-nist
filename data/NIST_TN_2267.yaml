abstract:
- content: 'The National Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology conducted a series of large compartment fire tests to investigate
    the behavior and fire-induced failure mechanisms of full-scale composite floor
    assemblies with a two-story steel gravity frame, two bays by three bays in plan.
    A total of three 9.1 m × 6.1 m composite floor specimens with varying slab reinforcement
    and fire protection schemes for the secondary beam were tested under combined
    mechanical loads and compartment fire exposure. This report presents the experimental
    design and results from the third composite floor fire experiment (Test #3). The
    first experiment (Test #1) was designed to achieve a 2-hour fire resistance rating
    per current U.S. practice and create baseline data for the behavior of the building.
    Test #1 specimen exhibited mid-panel slab integrity failure at 70 mins of fire
    exposure. Test #2 was conducted to study the effect of enhanced slab reinforcement
    with larger area and ductility on the fire resilience of the composite floor systems.
    Test #2 showed that the use of enhanced slab reinforcement maintained the structural
    integrity of the tested slab for more than two hours. Test #3 was conducted to
    study the effect of enhanced slab reinforcement as well as unprotected secondary
    beams on the fire resilience of the composite floor systems. Similar to Test #2,
    the floor slab in the test bay was reinforced with 9.5 mm diameter deformed bars
    with a center-to-center spacing of 30 cm (230 mm2/m). Unlike in Test #1 and Test
    #2, the secondary beam and its end connections in the test bay were left unprotected
    in Test #3. The test floor was mechanically loaded to 2.7 kPa to mimic the code-prescribed
    gravity loads for fire conditions. The compartment test fire created upper-layer
    gas temperatures like those in standard fire resistance tests. A total of four
    natural gas burners distributed over the compartment floor created a peak gas
    temperature exceeding 1100 °C below the test floor. A wide transverse crack with
    flame leak above the floor developed at 132 min in the mid-panel region. The mid-panel
    vertical displacement reached 535 mm (equivalent to the ratio of L/17 where the
    span length L = 9.1 m) It reached a peak value of 655 mm (L/14) at 140 min, when
    the actuator loading was removed. The Test #3 showed that the use of deformed
    steel bars (230 mm2/m) for the slab reinforcement maintained the structural integrity
    of the tested slab longer than the specified rating period with an unprotected
    secondary beam. The experimental results presented in this report can be used
    for validation of predictive models to perform parametric studies incorporating
    the variability in the steel reinforcement scheme (area, spacing, and material)
    for safer and cost-effective composite floor construction for fire safety.'
