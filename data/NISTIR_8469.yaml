abstract:
- content: The recently revised ASME B89.4.19-2021 and ISO 10360-10:2021 standards
    for laser trackers include a new interim test that is comprehensive and more sensitive
    to systematic errors than the interim tests in the previous versions of the standards,
    i.e., the ASME B89.4.19-2006 and ISO 10360-10:2016. This interim test can be performed
    by users periodically in the field to assess the health of their trackers. There
    are two components to this interim test â€“ the first is designed to detect geometric
    errors in laser trackers while the second is designed to assess the performance
    of the inclination sensor. In this report, we present an overview of the interim
    test for geometry errors, describe four methods of realizing the test, present
    performance evaluation data on a laser tracker from the different methods, and
    compare the methods in terms of their advantages and disadvantages.
