abstract:
- content: This report summarizes measurement challenges identified in four main pillars
    of global food safety (microbiological contaminants, chemical contaminants, allergens,
    and authenticity and adulteration) as described by the experts assembled at the
    workshop and explores potential future actions needed to improve food safety measurement
    science. This paper is accompanied by a second, complementary report on the international
    capabilities across national metrology institutes (NMIs) and other reference material
    producers present at the workshop and prospective actions to ensure global food
    safety.
