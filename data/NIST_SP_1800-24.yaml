abstract:
- content: Medical imaging plays an important role in diagnosing and treating patients.
    The system that manages medical images is known as the picture archiving communication
    system (PACS) and is nearly ubiquitous in healthcare environments. PACS is defined
    by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class II device that provides one
    or more capabilities relating to the acceptance, transfer, display, storage, and
    digital processing of medical images. PACS centralizes functions surrounding medical
    imaging workflows and serves as an authoritative repository of medical image information.
