abstract:
- content: 'Safety and quality of advanced therapies, including cellular, gene, and
    tissue-engineered medical products, is paramount for success of these products.
    Sterility assurance testing confirming the absence of microbial contamination
    in advanced therapy products is critical to establishing safety before patient
    dosing. To date, culture-based compendial methods are employed as the gold standard
    for sterility testing of pharmaceutical products. However, for advanced therapy
    therapy products, the required cultivation period (e.g., 14 days or more) is incompatible
    with the short (e.g., 2 days) product shelf life and jeopardizes healthcare outcomes
    for critically ill patients who need these lifesaving therapies. Alternative rapid
    microbial testing methods are increasingly being evaluated to reduce test result
    turnaround time for advanced therapies, but are not yet widely adopted.NIST hosted
    a Rapid Microbial Testing Methods (RMTMs) Workshop on April 19, 2022 to address
    overarching themes relevant to the need to implement rapid microbial testing methods.
    The workshop''s goals were to identify measurement challenges and hurdles to adopting
    RMTMs for advanced therapy products and to share and obtain feedback on future
    efforts of the RMTM Consortium. To this end, subject matter experts from relevant
    legal, regulatory, and scientific/technological spaces were invited to give presentations
    related to two broad themes: 1. Barriers and Potential Solutions to Adoption of
    RMTMs, and 2. Technologies and Tools for Rapid Microbial Detection. Invited speakers
    also participated in panel discussions that actively engaged audience members
    via live polling during facilitated and impromptu discussions. This virtual workshop
    collectively served as a venue for shared knowledge and learning on the state
    of the field for RMTMs and hurdles in their broad adoption, consequently benefiting
    a diverse group of stakeholders. Additionally, the workshop promoted greater awareness
    of the NIST RMTM Consortium and its activities. Summaries of the presentations,
    discussion, and poll results are presented within this report.'
