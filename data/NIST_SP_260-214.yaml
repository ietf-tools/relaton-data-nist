abstract:
- content: NIST Reference Material (RM) 8256 Wild-caught Coho Salmon, RM 8257 Aquacultured
    Coho Salmon, RM 8258 Wild-caught Shrimp and RM 8259 Aquacultured Shrimp were generated
    for use in authentication, nutrition and food safety-related determinations of
    crude fat and fatty acids. Each unit consists of two jars containing 6 to 8 g
    of fresh frozen powder homogenate. RMs of the same type (e.g. fish or shellfish)
    can be used individually or in tandem for comparative studies. This publication
    documents the sourcing, measurement results and statistical analysis employed
    in characterizing each material.
