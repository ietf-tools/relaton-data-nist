abstract:
- content: HVAC-Cx is a software tool designed to facilitate performance analysis
    for mechanical equipment buildings. It is used for ongoing monitoring and provides
    the ability to detect faults related to improper operation, using expert rules
    to present results of the most likely fault causes and to assist in documenting
    results. The goal is to optimize the system performance in terms of occupant comfort,
    energy management and equipment life. It was conceived exclusively for tertiary
    buildings equipped with one (or several) AHUs, terminal units, chiller loops,
    and chillers. The commissioning methods developed can be applied to several types
    of equipment and custom rules can be introduced. The structure includes future
    expansion capabilities for the analysis of chillers.
