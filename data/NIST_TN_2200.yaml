abstract:
- content: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is focused on addressing
    the hazard of acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning of consumers from portable
    generators that can result in serious, long term health effects or death in exposed
    individuals. Under an interagency agreement with CPSC (CPSC-I-17-0023), the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted a series of tests on four
    commercially available portable generators advertised as certified to one of two
    voluntary standards requiring CO hazard mitigation systems for portable generators.
    These tests characterized the indoor CO concentrations and the associated calculated
    carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) profiles on simulated occupants when the generators were
    operated in or near a test house under various operational and environmental conditions.
    This report presents the measured CO data and calculated COHb levels from those
    tests. In addition, model validation tests and simulations were performed for
    2 Cases (3 tests each) to supplement those already reported in NIST Technical
    Note 2049.
