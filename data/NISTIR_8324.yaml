abstract:
- content: The interest in forensic techniques capable of detecting many different
    media manipulation types has been growing, and system development with machine
    learning technology has been evolving in recent years. There has been, however,
    a lack of diversity in the data collections and in the evaluation methodologies
    for advancing multimedia forensics technologies. For the forensics research community,
    a well-defined evaluation is necessary to rapidly measure the accuracy and robustness
    of systems over diverse datasets collected under various environments. In this
    paper, we propose an evaluation framework and associated performance metrics and
    apply them to the 2018 Multimedia Forensics Challenge (MFC18). This MFC18 evaluation
    consists of five tasks and two challenges. A large number of datasets were created
    to support each task and for conducting the experiments using a structured evaluation
    framework. A total of 25 teams participated in the MFC18 evaluation; we analyse
    their performance on the tasks and challenges, and provide performance rankings
    for each teamâ€™s best-performing system.
