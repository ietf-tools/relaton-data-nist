abstract:
- content: In this study, environmentally stressed OS fabrics containing melamine
    fiber blends were evaluated for thermal and mechanical properties that are critical
    to the protective performance of firefighter turnout gear. Environmental stress
    factors that affect the durability of turnout gear include thermal exposures,
    UV radiation, moisture exposures, abrasion, and laundering. The effect of fiber
    blend, fabric construction, and finishing processes including water repellent
    coating and pigmentation of melamine containing OS fabrics was also studied. Melamine
    containing OS fabrics show comparable thermal protective performance and have
    far more superior tear resistance when compared to the traditionally used polyaramid
    blends. This study reveals that TPP rating of environmentally stressed OS fabrics
    containing melamine fiber blends is well above the NFPA minimum TPP requirement
    of 35 Cal/cm2. The tear strength of all melamine containing OS fabrics exposed
    to environmental stressing has significantly deteriorated and most OS fabrics,
    depending on fiber blend and fabric structure, would fail to meet requirements
    of NFPA 1971 standard. The study thus suggests that environmental stressing has
    more detrimental impact on tear strength than the thermal protective performance
    of OS fabrics. Deterioration in tearing strength of all UV exposed OS fabrics
    is largely due to photodegradation of constituent fibers. Changes in tear strength
    of OS fabrics subjected to thermal exposures and laundering is cumulative effect
    of loss in tensile strength of single yarns and dimensional stability of the fabric
    itself.
