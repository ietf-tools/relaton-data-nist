- content: Firewalls are devices or programs that control the flow of network traffic
    between networks or hosts employing differing security postures. This publication
    provides an overview of several types of firewall technologies and discusses their
    security capabilities and their relative advantages and disadvantages in detail.
    It also makes recommendations for establishing firewall policies and for selecting,
    configuring, testing, deploying, and managing firewall solutions.
