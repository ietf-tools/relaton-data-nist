abstract:
- content: In this report, we present network measurement of an ISA100.11a industrial
    wireless network operating with existing WiFi interference. The IEEE802.15.4-based
    ISA100.11a wireless protocol operates at the 2.4 GHz band for various industrial
    application. IEEE802.11 WiFi also may operates at the 2.4 GHz band for industrial
    and data applications in the same environment. The existing IEEE 802.11 wireless
    network would have a negative impact on the rated performance parameters of the
    ISA100.11a networks. In this work, we study WiFi interference impacts on the performance
    of a single ISA100.11a node using the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) wireless testbed.
