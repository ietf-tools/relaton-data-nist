abstract:
- content: This analysis is an attempt to quantify the number and type of interactions
    between NIST and the U.S. economy from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014.
    These interactions of diverse types include those between NIST and other government
    entities, academic institutions, and private businesses. Together they demonstrate
    the true size of the organizations' scientific footprint.
