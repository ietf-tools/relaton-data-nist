abstract:
- content: 'In 2000, NIST announced the selection of the Rijndael block cipher family
    as the winner of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. Block ciphers
    are the foundation for many cryptographic services, especially those that provide
    assurance of the confidentiality of data. Three members of the Rijndael family
    are specified in this Standard: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. Each of them transforms
    data in blocks of 128 bits, and the numerical suffix indicates the bit length
    of the associated cryptographic keys.'
