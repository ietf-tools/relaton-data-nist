abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication
    replaces National Bureau of Standards (NBS) Letter Circular LC1132 published April
    19, 1982. It reprints the Department of Commerce, NIST, Federal Register notice
    of December 20, 1990 titled 'Metric System of Measurement; Interpretation of the
    International System of Units for the United States' (the International System
    of Units, abbreviated SI, is the modernized metric system); the Department of
    Commerce, Office of the Secretary. Federal Register notice of January 2, 1991
    titled 'Metric Conversion Policy for Federal Agencies'; and Executive Order 12770
    issued by the President of the United States on July 25, 1991 titled 'Metric Usage
    in Federal Government Programs.' The first Federal Register notice restates the
    Department of Commerce's interpretation of the International System of Units for
    the United States that was last published by the Department in 1982; the second
    revises the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to remove the voluntary aspect of
    the conversion to the metric system of measurement for Federal agencies; and the
    Executive Order provides Presidential authority and direction for the use of the
    metric system of measurement by Federal departments and agencies in their programs.
    Also included is a diagram that shows graphically how the 19 SI derived units
    with special names are derived in a coherent manner from the SI base and supplementary
    units.
