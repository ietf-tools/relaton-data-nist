abstract:
- content: This publication provides the policies and plans for the PT Program of
    the NIST Office of Weights and Measures. This Office of Weights and Measures (OWM)
    Proficiency Testing (PT) policy and plan has been updated to ensure compliance
    with the latest applicable documentary standards and policies of the International
    Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). The PT program has been in place
    since the early 1980s as a core part of the support to State weights and measures
    laboratories through regional measurement assurance programs. Original activities
    were conducted as round robins in support of ongoing measurement assurance activities
    related to support for State laws with requirements for metrological traceability
    to national and international standards. Kelleen Larson, L. F. Eason, and Ken
    Fraley in collaboration with NIST OWM personnel at the 2012 PT Workshop, Boulder,
    Colorado, proposed significant updates to this publication, which form the foundation
    for the 2018 update. Reviews by the participants listed below significantly contributed
    to the development of this policy and plan. The initial 2004 edition was developed
    under contract with Jeff C. Gust.
