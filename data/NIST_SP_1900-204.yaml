abstract:
- content: This report highlights the GCTC/SC3 Expo event held on July 11-12, 2019
    to foster discussion of and collaboration to address the cybersecurity and privacy
    challenges faced by cities as they implement smart technologies. Over 1000 representatives
    from cities, industry, government, private institutions and academia with an interest
    in smart cities attended the event. The event included a series of plenary and
    panel sessions, interactive technical breakout sessions and open forums related
    to the GCTC domains. The February 2018 GCTC/SC3 Kickoff in Washington DC and June
    2018 Global Tech Jam in Portland, Oregon, USA, contributed to the success of this
    event.
