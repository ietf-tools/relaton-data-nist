abstract:
- content: This report documents efforts to date to automate Piston Gage Calibration
    Services. This report includes an overview of the project, results for Phase I
    Implementation efforts, and a look ahead to Phase II. Phase I Measures and Deliverables
    are based on the Piston Gage Calibration Phase I Implementation Project Charter
    dated 11-21-2014. All results were based on average inputs required to complete
    the calibration of a single 29010C Deadweight Piston Gage.
