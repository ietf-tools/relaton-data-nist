abstract:
- content: While opportunities exist with Big Data, the data can overwhelm traditional
    technical approaches. To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public
    Working Group (NBD-PWG) is working to develop consensus on important, fundamental
    concepts related to Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability
    Framework (BDIF) series of volumes. This volume, Volume 7, contains summaries
    of the work presented in the other six volumes, an investigation of standards
    related to Big Data, and an inspection of gaps in those standards.
