abstract:
- content: In this work we provide a summary of the National Conference of Standards
    Laboratories (NCSL) Recommended Practice RP-1 calibration interval analysis method,
    and examples of the method applied to three sets of available NIST data (two models
    of radiation survey meters and an electronic dosimeter). Information is provided
    for how to develop control charts to monitor individual instruments' performance
    over time in order to determine when instrument requires recalibration; examples
    are provided for a survey meter and a gamma-ray spectrometer.
