abstract:
- content: This study is meant to be applied to residential, unitary, air-source,
    single-speed, vapor compression air-conditioning systems with nominal cooling
    capacities less than 19 kW (65,000 Btu h-1 or 5.4 tons). In this research, a method
    for self-training FDD and the new concepts of zone density and operational domain
    coverage rate are introduced. Various fault-free correlation techniques, such
    as ANN (artificial neural network), MPR (multivariable polynomial regression),
    and combined ANN-MPR, are demonstrated and compared for self-training FDD. For
    the validation of this method, a full FDD algorithm was developed to include eight
    scenarios (1- fault-free, 2-compressor valve leakage, 3-improper outdoor air flow,
    4-improper indoor air flow, 5-liquid-line restriction, 6-refrigerant undercharge,
    7-refrigerant overcharge, and 8- presence of non-condensable gases) using data
    from 72 fault-free and 84 faulty tests.
