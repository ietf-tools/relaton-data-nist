abstract:
- content: This study set out to examine the operational impact of introducing contactless
    fingerprint imagery to a modern fingerprint matching system that was designed
    for touch-collected images in either a standard Ten-Print operational matching
    pathway or a Mobile ID optimized operational pathway, depending on configuration.
    Contactless fingerprint imagery from six contactless devices were used, along
    with mated imagery from two touch-based devices using a block experimental design.
    Experimental cases were defined for the matching of contactless fingerprint imagery
    as either probe or biometric reference database, and system matching accuracy
    measured in terms of false negative identification rate (FNIR). Due to the small
    data set available, the experiment was not structured to measure false positive
    error rates. Results showed the viability of using contactless imagery as the
    biometric reference database, albeit using these images will come at the price
    of matching accuracy on the Ten-Print matcher (FNIR of 0.5?% worst case for touch
    devices vs. FNIR of 1.6?% best case for contactless). The Mobile ID matcher seemed
    to close the gap between contactless and touch with the best performing contactless
    device in terms of accuracy (D3) performing at an FNIR of 0.8?% while the worst
    performing touch-to-touch device was measured at FNIR of 0.5?% showing that Mobile
    ID optimizations may be key in the introduction of contactless into existing matching
    pathways. Finally, the introduction of contactless imagery did incur a larger
    throughput penalty on the Ten- Print matcher than it did on the Mobile ID operational
    matcher.
