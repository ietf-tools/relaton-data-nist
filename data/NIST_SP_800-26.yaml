abstract:
- content: Self-assessments provide a method for agency officials to determine the
    current status of their information security programs and, where necessary, establish
    a target for improvement. This self-assessment guide utilizes an extensive questionnaire
    containing specific control objectives and techniques against which an unclassified
    system or group of interconnected systems can be tested and measured. The guide
    does not establish new security requirements. The control objectives and techniques
    are abstracted directly from long-standing requirements found in statute, policy,
    and guidance on security. This document builds on the Federal IT Security Assessment
    Framework (Framework) developed by NIST for the Federal Chief Information Officer
    (CIO) Council. The Framework established the groundwork for standardizing on five
    levels of security status and criteria agencies could use to determine if the
    five levels were adequately implemented. This document provides guidance on applying
    the Framework by identifying 17 control areas, such as those pertaining to identification
    and authentication and contingency planning. In addition, the guide provides control
    objectives and techniques that can be measured for each area.
