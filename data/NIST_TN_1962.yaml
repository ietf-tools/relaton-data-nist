abstract:
- content: At a time when more than 70% of the calls made to 911 are placed from cell
    phones, it is vital for Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to be able to dispatch
    emergency responders to the right location for the caller. A major challenge in
    this area is the location accuracy of E911 calls placed from inside buildings.
    According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)1 , more than 10,000 people,
    who would otherwise be saved, die every year when calling 911 from a cellphone
    because emergency dispatchers can⁰₉t get a quick and accurate location on them.
    The latest rules from the FCC require 50- meter horizontal location accuracy or
    providing dispatchable location for 80% of E911 calls by April 2021. As for vertical
    accuracy, the FCC has called for one or more vertical (z-axis) location accuracy
    metrics to be defined by nationwide providers and certain benchmarks, yet to be
    defined, based on those metrics to be met by certain dates. The Safety App from
    911Cellular, LLC is a Wi-Fi-based app for placing E911 calls. In December 2016,
    NIST tested and evaluated the Safety App in a comprehensive manner according to
    the procedures of the international standard ISO/IEC 18305, Test and evaluation
    of localization and tracking systems, in a large, four-story building on the NIST
    campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The Safety App achieved an average horizontal
    accuracy of 7.45 meters, it had a horizontal accuracy of 15.11 meters or better
    in 95% of the area of the building, and correctly decided from which floor the
    E911 call was placed in 87.6% of the area of the building. These results for a
    technology that is available today are far better than what FCC rules have called
    for by 2021. However, to achieve this level of accuracy everywhere (i.e., in every
    building), there has to be good Wi-Fi coverage and access to the Internet everywhere.
    The key questions are (i) what the penetration rate of Wi-Fi is now and (ii) what
    it will be by 2021. One clear trend is that Wi-Fi is being deployed in more buildings
    every day. When Wi-Fi access to the Internet is not available, the Safety App
    falls back to the use of GPS and RF signals received by the cellular base stations
    from the cell phone, which are the traditional solutions to estimate the location
    of E911 calls. Therefore, one point that can be made is that Wi-Fi-based E911
    solutions should be used along with the traditional solutions to improve the indoor
    location accuracy of E911 calls, just as the 911Cellular Safety App does. The
    Safety App has a very simple operation and its performance does not degrade in
    high rise buildings. Even though NIST tested the Safety App in a four-story building,
    the App⁰₉s performance would be just as good in a 100-story building, as long
    as the Wi-Fi coverage on all floors of the building are the same. Nevertheless,
    it is important to test the Safety App in a few other buildings to study the effects
    of various construction materials, layout, etc. This report presents in detail
    the testing methodology and test results that were obtained.
