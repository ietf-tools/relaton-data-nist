abstract:
- content: Between 2005 and 2016, US multifactor productivity declined an average
    0.3 % annually. Some debate has ensued about the cause of this decline or whether
    there even was a decline in productivity. One aspect of productivity that is neglected
    in the literature is the effect of flow time on production and productivity. This
    paper examines the impact that innovations in material, finished goods, and work-in-process
    flow time have on productivity and production, measured using the multifactor
    productivity index and manufacturing value added. Using data on US manufacturing
    from 2005 to 2015, 12 regression models are presented and 19 simulations are developed
    to examine the impact of flow time on productivity and value added. The flow time
    for work-in-process goods and that for inventories is examined. The results suggest
    that flow time innovations have a significant impact on multifactor productivity
    and production. That is, manufacturers can increase productivity through flow
    time or lose productivity through increases in flow time, as might be expected.
    The more significant findings are in regards to the magnitude of impact of flow
    time. A simulated 20 % decrease in work-in-process flow time results in a 1.21
    % increase in multifactor productivity and a 2.23 % increase in value added. A
    simulated 20 % decrease in material and finished goods flow time increases productivity
    by 0.29 % and increases value added by 2.80 %. These changes may seem small; however,
    the average industry s work-in-process flow time from 2005 to 2015 increased 98.8
    %. During this same period, multifactor productivity declined an average of 2.2
    %. If flow time had remained unchanged from 2005, however, multifactor productivity
    would have increased between 1.73 % and 3.38 % through other factors, according
    to our model.
