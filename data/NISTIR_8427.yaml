abstract:
- content: The NIST SP 800-90 series [1][2][3] supports the generation of high-quality
    random bits for cryptographic and non-cryptographic use. The security strength
    of a random number generator depends on the unpredictability of its outputs. This
    unpredictability can be measured in terms of entropy, which the NIST SP 800-90
    series measures using min-entropy. A full-entropy bitstring has an amount of entropy
    equal to its length. Full-entropy bitstrings are important for cryptographic applications,
    as these bitstrings have ideal randomness properties and may be used for any cryptographic
    purpose. Due to the difficulty of generating and testing full-entropy bitstrings,
    the SP 800-90 series assumes that a bitstring has full entropy if the amount of
    entropy per bit is at least 1 - ε, where ε is at most 2^{-32}. This report provides
    a justification for the selection of this value of ε.
