abstract:
- content: 'This report presents experimental investigations of the performance of
    cold-formed steel lateral force-resisting systems (CFS-LRFS) under combinations
    of simulated earthquake and fire loading. Three types of shear wall systems are
    investigated: gypsum-sheet steel composite panel sheathed walls, oriented strand
    board (OSB) sheathed walls, and steel strap braced walls. Twenty-two 2.7 m tall
    by 3.7 m long test specimens are subjected sequentially to combinations of mechanical
    (cyclic shear deformation) and thermal (fire) load. The mechanical loading setup
    and protocol are based on ASTM E2126 Method C (CUREE Basic Loading Protocol).
    Fire loads of varying intensity that represent the characteristics of actual fires
    are investigated. The work is a step toward developing fragility curves (representations
    of the probability of exceeding a given damage state as a function of an engineering
    demand parameter) for these systems and is essential for performance-based design
    for fire.'
