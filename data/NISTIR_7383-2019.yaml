abstract:
- content: This publication contains Good Measurement Procedures (GMP), Good Laboratory
    Procedures (GLP), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for use in calibration
    laboratories performing volumetric calibrations. It includes procedures for Volume
    Transfer and Gravimetric Calibrations. This edition includes updates for statistical
    applications in measurement assurance that were implemented in mass calibrations
    in 2018.
