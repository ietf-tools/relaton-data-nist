abstract:
- content: SCAP Composer is a software application for creating Security Content Automation
    Protocol (SCAP) source data stream collections from Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) documents valid with respect to schemas defined in SCAP component specifications.
    SCAP Composer's limited scope and small footprint make it easy to install, use,
    and integrate with other SCAP content development tools. SCAP Composer uses the
    DITA Open Toolkit, an open source publishing engine for content authored in the
    Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). SCAP Composer may be used with
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SCAP Content Validation
    Tool to check the conformance of SCAP source data stream components to content
    requirements and recommendations.
