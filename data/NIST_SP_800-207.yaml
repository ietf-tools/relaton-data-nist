abstract:
- content: Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms
    that move defenses from static, network- based perimeters to focus on users, assets,
    and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan
    industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there
    is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their
    physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or
    based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and
    authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before
    a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust is a response to
    enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD),
    and cloud- based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network
    boundary. Zero trust focus on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows,
    network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer
    seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document
    contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general
    deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise's
    overall information technology security posture.
