abstract:
- content: This document describes the online leaderboard public evaluation program,
    Open Media Forensics Challenge (OpenMFC) 2021-2022. In the report, first, the
    introduction, objectives, challenges, contributions, and achievements of the evaluation
    program are covered and discussed in the Section 1. Second, the evaluation website,
    tasks, datasets, and the leaderboard interface are described in the Section 2.
    The participants system performance results are also presented in this section.
    Third, the community engagements, findings, and public participants difficulties
    are summarized in the Section 3. Then, two new studies for the next year evaluation,
    OpenMFC 2021-2022, are introduced in the same section. After that, the solutions
    to help public participants and the OpenMFC 2021-2022 work plan are proposed in
    the Section 4. Finally, the potential impacts are predicated in the Section 5.
    In the OpenMFC 2020-2021 evaluation, 56 participants registered the program, and
    194 public researchers worldwide received MFC datasets. Since 2016, NIST has released
    MFC dataset to more than 500 individuals, 200 organizations, from 26 countries
    and regions worldwide.
