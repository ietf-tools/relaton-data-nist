abstract:
- content: 'The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted the Industry
    Forum: Advanced Monitoring, Diagnostic, and Prognostic for Manufacturing Operations
    on May 8- 11, 2018, on the NIST Gaithersburg (Maryland) campus. The purpose of
    the Industry Forum was to discuss the current trends, successes, challenges, and
    needs related to advanced monitoring, diagnostic, and prognostic technologies
    (collectively known as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)) for enhancing
    maintenance and control strategies within manufacturing operations. The conclusion
    of the event featured an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Standards
    meeting for the Advanced Monitoring, Diagnostics, and Prognostics for Manufacturing
    Operations Subcommittee1 to prioritize work activities for standards and guidelines.
    This report documents the four-day event, summarizing presentations and brainstorming
    sessions, in addition to detailing the key priority topics for standards and guidelines.
    The next steps in this effort are presented towards the end of this document,
    including planning for the next standards meeting (which has since occurred in
    October 2018 in Cincinnati, Ohio) and the 2019 Measurement and Evaluation for
    Prognostics and Health Management in Manufacturing Forum (ME4PHM) workshop.'
