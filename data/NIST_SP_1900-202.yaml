abstract:
- content: 'This NIST Special Publication describes the relationship between the phrases
    ''cyber-physical systems'' and ''Internet of Things.'' CPS and IoT both refer
    to trends in integrating digital capabilities, including network connectivity,
    with physical devices and systems. This document describes the origins of these
    terms, analyzes the range of definitions over time, describes a unified perspective,
    and explores implications of this perspective. Four categories of overlap were
    identified in publications comparing and contrasting CPS and IoT. The distinctions
    hinge on three issues: control, internet, and human interactions. The lack of
    consistent distinguishing metrics and the convergence of definitions indicate
    an emerging consensus around the equivalence of CPS and IoT concepts. This convergence
    creates opportunities for progress through integrating the research, innovation,
    and standards efforts of the respective communities. Two models provide the bases
    for a unified CPS/IoT perspective. A unified components model provides 4 categories
    for CPS and IoT systems components: logical, physical, transducing, and human.
    A unified interactions model provides a formal basis for describing the performance
    of CPS and IoT systems. The unified perspective can be expressed as follows: Internet
    of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems comprise interacting logical, physical, and
    human components engineered for function through integrated logic and physics.
    Three criteria based on a characteristic set of components, capabilities, and
    functions are proposed for interchangeably labeling a system ''CPS'' or ''IoT''.
    Implications of a unified CPS and IoT perspective include the need for new hybrid
    discrete and continuous methods as science and engineering foundations for CPS/IoT
    design, operation, and assurance; and the importance of tight logical-physical
    linkage as the basis for the transformational nature of CPS/IoT systems.'
