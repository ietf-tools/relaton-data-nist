abstract:
- content: Casualties in fires--and in particular, deaths--are tail events. The average
    fire does not cause deaths or injuries. There is increasing evidence that the
    people susceptible to dying in fires are a specific subset of the people in homes.
    It seems likely that the same holds true of the fire and the environment as well.
    That is, that it is a suite of circumstances that produce deaths (and to a lesser
    extent injuries) in fires. While there has been a lot of valuable work aimed at
    identifying characteristics associated with deaths in fire, there has been little
    aimed at identifying those suites of conditions that produce fire deaths. One
    that can be readily identified is a cigarette fire ignited on or in the immediate
    vicinity of a person who is frail. Other suites of circumstances are less clear.
    There are a number of observations that can be made based on the research regarding
    fire in domestic environments. The large majority of fires are not reported to
    the fire department, and evidence suggests that the majority of those fires are
    put out by the people on site. This occurs in spite of the frequent admonition
    to Get out, Stay out.... \cite{thompson_2015}. It is a reminder that people do
    not necessarily always act in accordance with fire-safety messaging. The typical
    engineering approach to fire design--ASET/RSET--does not explicitly capture all
    observed behaviors in domestic fires. The basic assumption of the approach is
    that people react to a fire by evacuating, and that the time to evacuate is mostly
    independent of the fire. But these assumptions break down for domestic fires.
    A different approach is warranted for fire design for domestic spaces.
