abstract:
- content: 'From 1984 to 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) and its precursor the National Burearu of Standards (NBS) coordinated what
    became the Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) for laboratories
    that measure fat soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum and plasma. This
    report describes the design of and results for the 1984 and 1985 MMQAP Fat Soluble
    Vitamins and Carotenoids in Human Serum measurement comparability improvement
    studies: Round Robins I, II, III, and V (selenium and zinc were the only analytes
    in Round Robin IV). The test samples were: calibration solutions in Round Robins
    I and II, fortified sera in Round Robin III, and natural plasma in Round Robin
    V. Participant results were received for: Round Robin I between November 11 and
    December 24, 1984; Round Robin II between January 14 and February 19, 1985; Round
    Robin III between March 2 and May 30, 1985; and Round Robin V between August 7
    and December 12, 1985.'
