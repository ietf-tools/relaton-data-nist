abstract:
- content: 'In early October 2016 Hurricane Matthew crossed North Carolina as a category
    1 storm with some areas receiving 15-18 inches of rainfall on already saturated
    soil. The NIST-funded Center for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning (Center)
    teamed with researchers from NIST''s Community Resilience, Disaster Failure Studies,
    and Applied Economics programs to conduct a quick response field study focused
    on the small city of Lumberton, NC and the flooding experienced from the Lumber
    River. Approximately one year later, the Center and NIST team returned to Lumberton
    to document and better understand Lumberton''s recovery progress with an emphasis
    on housing, businesses, schools, community and state-level decisions, and the
    intersection of these sectors in community recovery. This type of investigation
    is critical for the study of community resilience as it will ultimately provide
    longitudinal recovery data and analyses to support guidance and recommendations
    on what is needed to enable communities the ability to recover more quickly and
    equitably, and more generally, what attributes make most communities more resilient
    to natural hazards. This second in a series of community resilience-focused field
    studies is presented herein as Wave 2 of the on-going Lumberton, North Carolina
    Flood of 2016 report series. Wave 2 had two major objectives: First, to document
    community interdependencies ; and secondly, to document the progress of Lumberton''s
    recovery. Both of these objectives support data needs for understanding resilience
    and recovery. Wave 2 dealt primarily with the recovery process of the most heavily
    affected households and businesses through systematic surveys. Analysis revealed
    that even after 14 months, Lumberton is only in the early stages of recovery.'
