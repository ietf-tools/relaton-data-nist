abstract:
- content: The NIST Health Assessment Measurements Quality Assurance Program (HAMQAP)
    was launched in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office
    of Dietary Supplements (ODS) in 2017. HAMQAP was established to enable laboratories
    to improve the accuracy of measurements for demonstration of compliance with various
    regulations by measuring samples that represent human intake (e.g., foods, dietary
    supplements, tobacco) and samples that represent human output (e.g., blood, serum,
    plasma, urine). Analytes are paired where possible to represent the full spectrum
    of health assessment. Exercise 1 of this program offered the opportunity for laboratories
    to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional elements (iron and transferrin),
    contaminants (arsenic species and mycotoxins), water-soluble vitamins (vitamin
    B12), fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin D and metabolites), fatty acids, and botanical
    marker compounds (actein and 27-deoxyactein) in foods, botanical or dietary supplement
    ingredients, and human serum, plasma, or urine.
