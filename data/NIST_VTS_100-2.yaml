abstract:
- content: Accessible voting systems are a key feature in polling places that enable
    voters with disabilities to vote privately and independently. The Help America
    Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) requires that each polling place have a voting system
    that is “accessible for individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual accessibility
    for the blind and visually impaired,” and that it must provide “the same opportunity
    for access and participation (including privacy and independence) as for other
    voters.” These systems must be available for all voters, but many voters who are
    blind or have low vision, voters with mobility disabilities or who lack manual
    dexterity, and voters with cognitive disabilities need accessible voting systems
    to vote privately and independently. This report and sample training slide presentation
    (available for download and modification at https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.VTS.100-2sup1)
    are intended to assist election officials as they develop their poll worker training
    to support voters with disabilities at the polling place. This work is in response
    to the inconsistency of available training materials for poll workers on how to
    set up accessible voting systems and support voters in using them. In addition
    to ensuring that poll workers know the legal rules for disability voting rights
    in the polling place, it includes guidance for helping voters while preserving
    their independence and privacy.
