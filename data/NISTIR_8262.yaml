abstract:
- content: System models and model-based engineering methods have the promise of transforming
    the way that industrial engineers interact with production and logistics systems.
    Model-based methods play a role in improving communication between stakeholders,
    interoperability between systems, automated access to consistent analysis models,
    and multi-disciplinary design methods for complex systems. However, there remains
    a need for a foundation for modeling these kinds of systems ⁰₃ a foundation that
    tailors methods and tools developed in other engineering domains to the unique
    concepts and semantics of production and logistics. This foundation is the topic
    of this report. This report documents a framework and model libraries for modeling
    discrete event logistics systems (DELS), an abstraction that covers manufacturing
    plants, material handling and transportation systems, warehouses, supply chains,
    etc. The DELS abstraction was created by identifying and modeling commonalities
    across the kinds of systems that industrial engineers typically encounter, and
    analysis models they use to analyze those system. It extends well-known product,
    process, and resource (PPR) ontologies to incorporate a library of operational
    control model components, and is connected to Commodity Flow Network (CFN), modeling
    networks, flow networks, and process networks. The relationship between DELS and
    CFN formally links system models to abstractions used to create analysis models,
    such as discrete event simulation. This report is the first public release of
    models and documentation capturing many years of refinement and application by
    the authors. As a first release, the goal is to solicit additional use cases and
    feedback from the community to improve the models and make them the foundation
    for the model-based industrial and systems engineering community.
