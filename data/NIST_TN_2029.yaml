abstract:
- content: This report presents the development of a Computable General Equilibrium
    (CGE) model for the regional economy of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The general approach
    that this case study takes is outlined in Helgeson et al. [1] as a method to quantify
    the net co-benefits of investing in increased resilience, or the "resilience dividend."
    The current report provides the background on Cedar Rapids as a case study in
    planning for increased resilience and provides an overview of the CGE model of
    Cedar Rapids at two different time periods. This report is intended to provide
    context and background for future applications of the Cedar Rapids CGE model to
    quantify the resilience dividend.
