abstract:
- content: The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a suite of specifications
    that standardize the format and nomenclature by which software flaw and security
    configuration information is communicated, both to machines and humans. This publication,
    along with its annex (NIST Special Publication 800-126A) and a set of schemas,
    collectively define the technical composition of SCAP version 1.3 in terms of
    its component specifications, their interrelationships and interoperation, and
    the requirements for SCAP content.
