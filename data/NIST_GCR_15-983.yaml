abstract:
- content: This white paper presents the current, international, state-of-the-art
    large-scale experimental, modeling, and performance-based design (PBD) efforts
    related to structural fire resistance of concrete structures. The paper addresses
    these topics with emphasis on research and development needs for large-scale experiments
    on fire resistance of structures to support performance-based engineering and
    structure-fire model validation; prioritizing those needs; phasing the needs in
    terms of near, medium and long term; identifying the most appropriate international
    laboratory facilities and collaborators available to address each need; identifying
    possible means to transfer the results of research to industry; and identifying
    a means for the coalition of international partners to review progress and exchange
    information on a regular basis.
