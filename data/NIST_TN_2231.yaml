    Laboratory conducted a cellular communication system pilot experiment in the summer
    of 2021. This pilot experiment was done to prepare for a broad-scope experiment
    to demonstrate anomaly detection from radiated emissions, possibly due to cyberattack.
    A goal of the pilot experiment was to check the experiment testbed for instabilities.
    A testbed is stable if measurements made over time with identical experiment settings
    exhibit no systematic variation. The data collected in the pilot experiment evidenced
    strong instabilities in the testbed's operation. These instabilities are seen
    in sequence plots of the experiment responses and, especially, in stabilograms
    devised expressly for this purpose in this work. Stabilograms are an intuitive
    and easy way to assess testbed instability. The instabilities reflected in the
    stabilograms are large enough to foreclose further analysis of the pilot data.
    The stabilograms from this study, though, suggest that if the testbed's instabilities
    can be effectively addressed, anomaly detection might be accomplished in the scenario
    under consideration.
