abstract:
- content: Big Data is a term used to describe the large amount of data in the networked,
    digitized, sensor-laden, information-driven world. While opportunities exist with
    Big Data, the data can overwhelm traditional technical approaches and the growth
    of data is outpacing scientific and technological advances in data analytics.
    To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
    is working to develop consensus on important, fundamental concepts related to
    Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework
    (NBDIF) series of volumes. This volume, Volume 7, contains summaries of the work
    presented in the other six volumes, an investigation of standards related to Big
    Data, and an inspection of gaps in those standards.
