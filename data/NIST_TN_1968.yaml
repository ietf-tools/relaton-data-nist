abstract:
- content: This paper quantifies the pool boiling performance of R134a, R1234yf, R513A,
    and R450A on a flattened, horizontal Turbo-ESP surface. The study showed that
    the boiling performance of R134a on the Turbo-ESP exceeded that of the replacement
    refrigerants for heat fluxes greater than 20 kWm-2. On average, the heat flux
    for R1234yf and R513A was 16 % and 19 % less than that for R134a, respectively,
    for R134a heat fluxes between 20 kWm-2 and 110 kWm-2. The heat flux for R450A
    was on average 57 % less than that of R134a for heat fluxes between 30 kWm-2 and
    110 kWm-2. A model was developed to predict both single-component and multi-component
    pool boiling of the test refrigerants on the Turbo-ESP surface. The model accounts
    for viscosity effects on bubble population and uses the Fritz (1935) equation
    to account for increased vapor production with increasing superheat. Both loss
    of available superheat and mass transfer resistance effects were modeled for the
    refrigerant mixtures. For most heat fluxes, the model predicted the measured superheat
    to within Â± 0.31 K.
