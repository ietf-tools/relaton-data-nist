abstract:
- content: Cylindrical tensile specimens were designed and prepared for in situ mechanical
    testing using X- ray computed tomography (XCT). Powder bed fusion-based metal
    additive manufacturing was used to produce tensile specimens to a near-net shape.
    Natural and designed defects were embedded in the tensile specimen using the additive
    manufacturing process. Conventional machining was used to refine the shape of
    the tensile specimens to their final shape with low surface roughness. The process
    of developing a cylindrical tensile specimen is described and recommendations
    for future builds are provided. An XCT-based dimensional measurement technique
    to inspect the part quality is introduced and described.
