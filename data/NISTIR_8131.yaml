abstract:
- content: Many homeowners and government programs are using insulating products,
    such as SPF, at a growing rateto increase the energy efficiency of their residences
    and other constructed buildings. Retrofitting or addition of foam insulation in
    new construction is also supported in the United States by Federal efforts, such
    as tax incentives, and programs like Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Energy
    Star and Design for the Environment. Because of these programs and other drivers
    for more efficient buildings, the insulation foam industry expects significant
    growth in the use of their products over the next few years. , SPF is used as
    both an insulation and a sealant. It is formed onsite via an exothermic chemical
    reaction between A-side and B-side chemicals and. The A-side typically consists
    of monomeric or polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. Polyols are part of
    the B-side chemicals, which also include amine and/or metal catalysts, blowing
    agents, surfactants, and flame retardants. Amine and/or metal catalysts are used
    to promote the reaction between polyols and A-side chemicals, which help polyurethane
    foam cells develop sufficient strength to maintain their structure and resist
    collapsing. CPSC, along with EPA and other federal agencies, has received a number
    of complaints regarding health effects resulting from the installation of SPF
    in homes. Residents have complained about a multitude of adverse effects including
    severe respiratory irritation, breathing difficulties, dizziness and nausea. In
    some cases, the reported effects are so severe that consumers report that they
    can no longer live in their homes. These health effects are reported to occur
    several days to months following the SPF installation in the home.
