abstract:
- content: This paper quantifies the pool boiling performance of R515A, R1234ze(E),
    and R1233zd(E) on a flattened, horizontal Turbo-ESP surface for air-conditioning
    applications for heat fluxes between roughly 10 kWm-2 and 100 kWm-2. Both R515A
    and R1234ze(E) are replacements for R134a, while R1233zd(E) is a replacement for
    R123. The measured boiling curve for R515A had roughly a 14 [percent] larger heat
    flux than that of R1234ze(E) for heat fluxes greater than 45 kWm-2. For heat fluxes
    between 14 kWm-2 and 85 kWm-2, R515A and R1234ze(E) exhibited a heat flux that
    was 33 [percent] and 17 [percent] larger than that for R134a. The heat flux of
    R1233zd(E) was roughly 18 [percent] larger than that for R123 for heat fluxes
    between 30 kWm-2 and 87 kWm-2. A pool boiling model that was previously developed
    for pure and mixed refrigerants on the Turbo-ESP surface was improved by nondimensionalizing
    the model constants and improving their statistical significance. For most heat
    fluxes, the model predicted the measured superheat to within +/- 0.7 K. The model
    was used to show that the vapor Prandtl number and the product of the latent heat
    and vapor density significantly influenced the boiling heat flux.
