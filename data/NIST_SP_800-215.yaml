abstract:
- content: Access to multiple cloud services, the geographic spread of enterprise
    Information Technology (IT) resources (including multiple data centers), and the
    emergence of microservices-based applications (as opposed to monolithic ones)
    have significantly altered the enterprise network landscape. This document is
    meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise network landscape from a secure
    operations perspective. Hence, it starts by examining the security limitations
    of current network access solutions to the enterprise network. It then considers
    security feature enhancements to traditional network appliances in the form of
    point security solutions, network configurations for various security functions
    (e.g., application/services security, cloud services access security, device or
    endpoint security), security frameworks that integrate these individual network
    configurations (e.g., zero trust network access [ZTNA]), and the evolving wide
    area network (WAN) infrastructure to provide a comprehensive set of security services
    for the modern enterprise network landscape (e.g., secure access service edge
    [SASE]).
