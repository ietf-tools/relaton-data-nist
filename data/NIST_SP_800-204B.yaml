abstract:
- content: Deployment architecture in cloud-native applications now consists of loosely
    coupled components, called microservices, with all application services provided
    through a dedicated infrastructure, called a service mesh, independent of the
    application code. Two critical security requirements in this architecture are
    to build (1) the concept of zero trust by enabling mutual authentication in communication
    between any pair of services and (2) a robust access control mechanism based on
    an access control such as attribute-based access control (ABAC) that can be used
    to express a wide set of policies and is scalable in terms of user base, objects
    (resources), and deployment environment. This document provides deployment guidance
    for building an authentication and authorization framework within the service
    mesh that meets these requirements. A reference platform for hosting the microservices-based
    application and a reference platform for the service mesh are included to illustrate
    the concepts in the recommendations and provide the context in terms of the components
    used in real-world deployments.
