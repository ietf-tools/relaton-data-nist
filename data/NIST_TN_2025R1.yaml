abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology has constructed the
    Intelligent Building Agents Laboratory (IBAL) to demonstrate the potential for
    distributed, intelligent software agents to optimize the control of heating, ventilation,
    and air-conditioning systems in commercial buildings. The goal of the optimization
    is to improve the economic and energy performance of building systems while maintaining
    occupant comfort. This paper describes the design of, and the equipment in, the
    airside system of the IBAL.
