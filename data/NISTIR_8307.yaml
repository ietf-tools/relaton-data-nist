abstract:
- content: This report describes computational comparison measurements as well as
    match error analysis applied to fingerprint images collected by researchers of
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in May of 2019. Fingerprint
    images from 200 Federal Employees were collected using both contact and contactless
    acquisition devices, including both stationary devices and mobile smartphone devices.
    Match scores from two different matchers were used to calculate False Negative
    Identification Rate (FNIR) and False Positive Identification Rate (FPIR) at two
    operational thresholds appropriate to each of the matchers. These values are displayed
    in graphical form across eight devices for each of ten finger combinations. Overall
    error performance is compared via Area Under Curve across devices for each of
    ten finger combinations as well as across finger combinations separately for each
    of the eight devices. Contact-to-contact interoperability remains superior to
    contactless-to-contact, but multiple finger combinations improve match performance
    of contactless devices.
