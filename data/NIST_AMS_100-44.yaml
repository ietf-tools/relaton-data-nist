abstract:
- content: There are several physical reasons for anisotropic mechanical properties
    in additively manufactured metals. These include but are not limited to directionally
    dependent grain and phase morphology; crystallographic texture; directional porosity/defects;
    and heterogeneity associated with the melt pool, layer wise microstructure. All
    of these are prevalent in most additive manufacturing processes, and it is difficult
    to separate out the role that each play in the mechanical anisotropy. This review
    focuses on studies that have attempted to or reasonably isolate one or two of
    these sources rather than simply report on trends in mechanical properties. This
    is not an exhaustive review covering all additive process or mechanical properties;
    the main assessment is on laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) metals and tensile test
    results (modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), elongation,
    and fracture surface analysis). In summary, the primary sources of anisotropic
    tensile properties for LPBF alloys are crystallographic texture, anisotropic microstructure
    morphologies, lack of fusion defects, and the melt pool macrostructure. Within
    anisotropic microstructures, elongated grains appear to be secondary compared
    to the preferential distribution of phases and features (e.g., grain boundary
    alpha, precipitates, etc.). Anisotropic modulus and yield strength are primarily
    caused by crystallographic texture. This is supported by crystal plasticity simulations.
    Anisotropic elongation is primarily caused by anisotropic microstructure morphologies,
    lack of fusion defects, and melt pool macrostructure. The evidence to support
    this comes from fracture surfaces that follow these features. Melt pool macrostructure
    is the most challenging to experimentally isolate from the list of other sources
    of anisotropy. Strategies to characterize and manipulate crystallographic texture,
    porosity, grain and phase morphology, and melt pool macrostructures are required
    to better understand and control mechanical anisotropy in AM metals.
