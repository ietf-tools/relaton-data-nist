abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology has developed advanced
    Database-Assisted Design (DAD) procedures for the design of structural members
    subjected to direction-dependent wind loads. Recently, a DAD_ETABS procedure that
    uses the ETABS software was developed with a view to facilitating the use of the
    DAD approach in structural engineering practice. DAD_ETABS is a powerful software
    package enabling DAD's unique safety and economy features to be part of general
    structural design practice. The purpose of this report is to review the main features
    of the DAD_ETABS structural design procedure and software and assess them from
    the point of view of its potential use in structural engineering design practice.
    The report presents a review of the procedure and the results of testing the performance
    of the DAD_ETABS software by performing an independent structural design of an
    example high-rise steel building. An assessment of the software and its potential
    for routine use in structural engineering design practice is then presented, followed
    by a set of recommendations on future work aimed at enhancing the software's capabilities
    as a widely used practical design tool.
