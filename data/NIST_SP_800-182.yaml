abstract:
- content: Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, entitled the Federal Information
    Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, requires NIST to prepare an annual public
    report on activities undertaken in the previous year, and planned for the coming
    year, to carry out responsibilities under this law. The primary goal of the Computer
    Security Division (CSD), a component of NIST s Information Technology Laboratory
    (ITL), is to provide standards and technology that protects information systems
    against threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
    and services. During Fiscal Year 2015 (FY 2015), CSD successfully responded to
    numerous challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that mission. Through CSD's
    diverse research agenda and engagement in many national priority initiatives,
    high-quality, cost-effective security and privacy mechanisms were developed and
    applied that improved information security across the federal government and the
    greater information security community. This annual report highlights the research
    agenda and activities in which CSD was engaged during FY 2015.
