abstract:
- content: In order to facilitate the development of applications and middleware that
    support the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card, NIST has developed a set
    of test PIV Cards and a supporting public key infrastructure (PKI). This set of
    test cards includes not only examples that are similar to cards issued today but
    also examples of cards with features that are expected to appear in cards that
    will be issued in the future. This document provides an overview of the test cards,
    the infrastructure that has been developed to support their use, and detailed
    specifications for each test card and for each certificate issued by the test
    PKI.
