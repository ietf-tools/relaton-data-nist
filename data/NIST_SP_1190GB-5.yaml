abstract:
- content: A major aspect of characterizing the built environment is identifying key
    infrastructure dependencies that may exist. Some of these dependencies are obvious;
    others are not. This Guide Brief focuses on Step 2, understanding the built environment,
    and focuses on understanding dependencies from an energy system perspective. It
    is intended to help the collaborative planning team understand where energy is
    a critical dependency for other systems in the community. The Guide Brief is also
    useful for planners who work with building inspection departments, planners for
    first responders, and planners who are responsible for shelters.
