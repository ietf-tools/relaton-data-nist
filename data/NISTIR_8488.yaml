abstract:
- content: A new generation of contactless fingerprint capture devices has recently
    emerged. These devices provide the ability to capture a fingerprint without making
    physical contact with the finger. There is anecdotal evidence that the process
    of capturing a fingerprint by making contact with it also introduces a certain
    amount of physical distortion to the finger being pressed against the collection
    medium. It is hypothesized that because contactless collection devices do not
    need to make physical contact with the finger bring captured, the resulting collections
    from contactless devices are expected to have no mechanical deformation introduced
    to the finger and provide better intraoperability and as well as better consistency
    between captures from the same device.This hypothesis was rejected in that observations
    in this study showed that contact collection devices have more consistency and
    less variability between successive captures using the same device.
