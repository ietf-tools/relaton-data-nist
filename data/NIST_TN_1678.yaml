abstract:
- content: This report summarizes a NIST study aimed at assessing the safety of parallel
    wire suspension bridge cables under thermal effects. Both low temperatures, potentially
    embrittling the bridge wires, and high temperatures, potentially softening the
    wires, are considered. Recommended thermal and mechanical properties of suspension
    bridge wire are developed based on published data and on tensile testing carried
    out as part of this study. These recommended properties are incorporated in a
    computational model developed to analyze the thermal and mechanical response of
    a parallel wire suspension bridge cable subjected to prescribed surface temperatures.
    The analysis results indicate that embrittlement due to low temperatures does
    not significantly reduce the ultimate capacity of the cable. Exposure to high
    temperatures, on the other hand, could lead to failure of the cable, due to thermal
    softening of the steel wires and thermal expansion, which causes the heated outer
    wires to shed load. Reducing the surface area exposed to high temperatures is
    found to increase the exposure time required to produce failure.
