abstract:
- content: 'NIST has developed a software package that allows users to fit test results
    obtained from Charpy or toughness tests as a function of test temperature, thereby
    obtaining so-called transition curves. Non-linear fitting is available for five
    regression models, two symmetric and three asymmetric, selected from the literature.
    The NIST software package includes: an Excel spreadsheet to establish initial
    values for model parameters, allowing users to obtain meaningful results for the
    asymmetric models, a Shiny App (web-based interface for R code) that provides
    an advanced analysis, including confidence bounds and uncertainties for the estimated
    parameters, and a macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet for a basic-level analysis (regressions
    curves, characteristic temperatures, and model selection statistics). Example
    data sets are also included in the NIST software package. The NIST software is
    tested on three Charpy absorbed energy datasets. Two datasets correspond to actual
    impact test results performed on various pipeline steels, while the third is a
    simulated dataset generated from predetermined model parameters. These datasets
    allow a thorough demonstration of the NIST software. The software is freely available
    to the scientific community for research purposes.'
