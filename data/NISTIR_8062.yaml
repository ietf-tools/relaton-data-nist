abstract:
- content: 'This document provides an introduction to the concepts of privacy engineering
    and risk management for federal information systems. These concepts establish
    the basis for a common vocabulary to facilitate better understanding and communication
    of privacy risk within federal information systems, and the effective implementation
    of privacy principles. This publication introduces two key components to support
    the application of privacy engineering and risk management: privacy engineering
    objectives and a privacy risk model.'
