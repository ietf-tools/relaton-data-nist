abstract:
- content: 'Valuable information was gathered from a broad representation of the additive
    manufacturing (AM) community (150 attendees from industry, government, academic,
    and regulatory agencies) during this workshop to understand what is needed to
    enable broader acceptance and increased use of metal AM in fatigue and fracture
    critical applications. The main needs identified during the workshop were: comprehensive
    understanding of processing-structure-properties (PSP) relationships, mature process
    and material models, trustworthy in-process monitoring and control, effective
    non-destructive inspection techniques, predictive design tools, and traditional
    and rapid qualification frameworks. Fatigue and fracture issues play the largest
    role in PSP relationships, and during the workshop many specific areas of interest
    were identified and prioritized. In general, PSP investigations should consider
    statistical variation an utilize both experimental and modeling efforts. A curated
    AM materials database was deemed highly beneficial to the PSP effort. PSP understanding
    will facilitate development of in-process monitoring and control, non-destructive
    inspection techniques, and predictive design tools. The main standardization opportunities
    identified include standard reporting procedures for AM to enhance understanding
    and facilitate comparison to other results. Evaluation of current fatigue and
    fracture test methods as well as non-destructive inspection methods was another
    standardization need. Finally, a standardized traditional AM qualification framework
    using the currently available AM processes and inspection techniques was deemed
    highly necessary, and many felt that regulatory agencies should lead this effort.'
