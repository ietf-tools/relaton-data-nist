abstract:
- content: 'With the newly created Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network, the
    public safety community is in the process of supplementing the use of land mobile
    radios with the use of a broader spectrum of technologies. As these technologies
    are being developed, researchers and industry alike need to focus on the end users
    - the first responders - in order to ensure successful and usable systems. Understanding
    the user population of first responders is key to improved usability. The NIST
    PSCR Usability Team conducted a multi-phase, mixed methods research project in
    order to provide greater understanding of public safety users, their experiences,
    and their technology needs and problems. This report, Phase 2, Volume 2, is the
    second in a series of reports on the data from the Phase 2 large-scale, nationwide
    survey of 7 182 first responders. Three specific topics in the first responder
    communication technology space, drawing on data from both Phase 1 and Phase 2
    of the project are presented: 1) mobile devices, apps, and software, 2) futuristic
    technology and virtual reality, and 3) technology used in large incidents. Findings
    suggest that broader access to affordable devices, particularly work-issued smartphones,
    and data through smartphone apps, most essential being email and mapping/navigation,
    could fill significant gaps in the public safety technology space, making the
    NPSBN build-out so important for public safety. It is also important to understand
    that what many first responders want for the future of public safety is technology
    that already exists for the general public, it just is not yet widespread in the
    public safety domain, e.g., single sign-on (SSO). Lastly, researchers and developers
    in the public safety domain should focus on solving the problems that first responders
    have with technology used for daily incident response, as it will also help them
    during large events.'
