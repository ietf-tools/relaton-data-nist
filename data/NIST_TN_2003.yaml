abstract:
- content: Building stakeholders need practical metrics, data, and tools to support
    decisions related to sustainable building designs, technologies, standards, and
    codes. The Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has addressed this high priority national need by extending its metrics
    and tools for sustainable building products, known as Building for Environmental
    and Economic Sustainability (BEES), to whole-buildings. A sustainability measurement
    system has been developed consisting of whole-building sustainability metrics
    that are based on innovative extensions to life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle
    costing (LCC) approaches involving whole-building energy simulations. The measurement
    system evaluates the sustainability of both the materials and the energy used
    by a building over time. It assesses the carbon footprint of buildings as well
    as 11 other environmental performance metrics, and integrates economic performance
    metrics to yield science-based measures of the business case for investment choices
    in high-performance green buildings. Building Industry Reporting and Design for
    Sustainability (BIRDS) applies the sustainability measurement system to an extensive
    whole-building performance database NIST has compiled for this purpose. Based
    on the NIST Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF), the BIRDS Low-Energy
    Residential Incremental Energy Efficiency Improvements Database includes energy,
    environmental, and cost measurements for 960 000 design variations of the NZERTF
    for Gaithersburg, MD for study periods ranging from 1 year to 30 years. Focusing
    on a single location allows for the consideration of incremental building energy
    efficiency measures, both those specified in the most recent International Energy
    Conservation Code (IECC) and those implemented in the NZERTF. Buildings designed
    to meet current energy codes can be compared to alternative building designs to
    determine the impacts of improving building energy efficiency on overall sustainability
    performance. This report describes the latest version of BIRDS (v4.0) including
    new options, namely natural gas-fired space and water heater equipment.
