abstract:
- content: 'On February 2, 2016, President Obama signed Executive Order (EO) 13717:
    Establishing a Federal Earthquake Risk Management Standard. The EO establishes
    a minimum level of seismic safety compliance for new and existing buildings that
    will be constructed, altered, leased, financed, or regulated by the Federal Government.
    The primary purpose of this standard is to enhance the seismic resilience of agencies
    by reducing risk to lives of building occupants and improving the probability
    of continued performance of buildings essential to agency operations and functions
    following future earthquakes. The EO requires that agencies whose activities are
    covered by the order submit a biennial report to the Director of the Office of
    Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) on their progress in implementing the order, commencing
    two years from the date of the order. NIST, as the lead agency of the National
    Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), is required by the EO to summarize
    agency compliance of the order in the biennial NEHRP report to Congress. This
    report serves as the first summary of agency efforts to comply with the EO. Because
    of legislative reporting changes in the NEHRP Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Public
    Law 115-307), this report is made available as an independent interim report until
    such time that it can be integrated into the official biennial NEHRP report to
    Congress.'
