abstract:
- content: 'Global production and consumption of plastics and its deposition in the
    environment are growing rapidly, while their life-cycle impacts to the environment
    are yet to be fully understood. This study reviews the existing literature with
    the goal of evaluating the state of current data and knowledge on plastics life-cycle
    environmental impacts. We identified 98 peer-reviewed journal papers, 25 reports,
    8 databases as well as 21 existing reviews on the environmental impacts of plastics.
    Our review shows that life-cycle approaches have been instrumental in gaining
    new insights on the environmental implications of plastics. Global life-cycle
    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from plastics, for example, is estimated to be
    around 1.7 Gt CO2 e yr -1 , which is substantially larger than the GHG emissions
    from global aviation. LCAs have also been widely employed in various comparative
    studies such as biomass v.s. petroleum-based plastics, single-use plastics v.s.
    multi-use alternatives, which often result in counterintuitive outcomes. However,
    our analysis also indicates that there still is a paucity of reliable data and
    tools for conducting LCAs of plastics. In particular, we find that Asia, the major
    plastic-producing region, is scarcely covered by existing literature and databases.
    In addition, the life-cycle impacts of plastic additives, and the degradation
    pathways and associated environmental, human and ecological impacts of plastics
    are poorly understood, limiting our ability to gauge the life-cycle impacts of
    plastics. Furthermore, we find that a consensus on the allocation of environmental
    impacts for the recycling and reuse of plastics is yet to be reached. We identify
    four major areas of future research including: (1) developing the method for reliable
    estimate of the amount of plastics entering the environment, (2) understanding
    plastics environmental degradation pathways, degradation byproducts, and their
    human and ecological impacts, (3) expanding the coverage of life-cycle inventory
    data across geographies and additives, and (4) building consensus on key methodological
    issues including those around allocation.'
