abstract:
- content: This report documents an experimental program designed to investigate High
    Energy Arcing Fault (HEAF) phenomena for low-voltage metal enclosed switchgear
    containing aluminum conductors. This report covers full-scale laboratory experiments
    using representative nuclear power plant (NPP) three-phase electrical equipment.
    Electrical, thermal, and pressure data were recorded for each experiment and documented
    in this report. This report covers experiments performed on two low-voltage switchgear
    units with each unit consisting of two vertical sections. The data collected supports
    characterization of the low-voltage HEAF hazard, and these results will be used
    to support potential improvements in fire probabilistic risk assessment (PRA)
    methods. The experiments were performed at KEMA Labs located in Chalfont, Pennsylvania.
    The experimental design, setup, and execution were completed by staff from the
    NRC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Sandia National
    Laboratories (SNL) and KEMA. In addition, representatives from the Electric Power
    Research Institute (EPRI) observed some of the experimental setup and execution.
    The HEAF experiments were performed between August 26 and August 29, 2019 on near-identical
    Westinghouse Type DS low-voltage metal-enclosed indoor switchgear. The three-phase
    arcing fault was initiated on the aluminum main bus or in select cases on the
    copper bus stabs near the breaker. These experiments used either nominal 480 V
    (AC) or 600 V (AC). Durations of the experiments ranged from approximately 0.4
    s to 8.3 s with fault currents ranging from approximately 9.2 kA to 19.3 kA. Real-time
    electrical operating conditions, including voltage, current, and frequency, were
    measured during the experiments. Heat fluxes and incident energies were measured
    with plate thermometers, radiometers, and slug calorimeters at various locations
    around the electrical enclosures. Environmental measurements of breakdown, conductivity,
    and electromagnetics were also taken. The experiments were documented with normal
    and high-speed videography, infrared imaging, and photography. The results, while
    limited, indicated the difficulty in maintaining and sustaining low-voltage arcs
    on aluminum components of sufficient duration and at a single point as observed
    from operating experience.
