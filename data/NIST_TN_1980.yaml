abstract:
- content: Version three of Advanced Wireless Services (AWS-3) radio systems will
    soon use spectrum that is adjacent to bands currently used by airborne telemetry
    links at U.S. government test and training ranges (TTRs). It is possible that
    out-of-band (OoB) and spurious emissions from AWS-3 base stations (within LTE
    these are referred to as evolved node Bs, or eNBs) and their associated mobile
    units (called user equipment or UEs) might cause interference to these adjacent-band
    telemetry receivers. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) analyses for such interference
    will rely on knowing the power spectra of the OoB and spurious emissions of AWS-3
    eNBs and UEs on frequencies used by telemetry link receivers. To determine these
    power spectra, the authors have measured transmitter OoB and spurious emissions
    of an AWS-3 eNB and selected UEs. Adaptive power attenuation allowed these measurements
    to be made with over 100 decibels (dB) of dynamic range. The measurements have
    been collected in a variety of resolution bandwidths, transmitter modulations,
    and types of transmitter loading (i.e., number of resource blocks used) for two
    measurement detector modes. The results of those measurements are provided in
    this report. In general, AWS-3 eNB and UE transmitted emission spectra are found
    to be insensitive to variations in transmitter modulations, and resource block
    configurations. The measured power spectra of the eNBs and UEs vary in direct
    proportion to measurement (or receiver) bandwidth (i.e., as 10 log measurement
    bandwidth) with an approximate offset of about 10 dB between peak and average
    levels. The measurement results indicate that AWS-3 eNB and UE power spectra were
    suppressed by at least 100 dB in the adjacent telemetry bands for the devices
    tested. The results can now be factored into EMC analyses for AWS-3 transmitters
    operating in proximity to telemetry receivers.
