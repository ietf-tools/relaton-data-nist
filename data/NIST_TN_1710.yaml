abstract:
- content: Existing and proposed U.S. flammability standards for soft furnishings
    such as mattresses and upholstered furniture specify a standard cigarette as the
    ignition source in smoldering resistance performance tests. With the introduction
    of reduced ignition propensity cigarettes into the marketplace, the specific conventional
    cigarette that has been widely used in testing for ignition resistance is no longer
    in production. A standard reference cigarette, SRM 1196, has been developed as
    a short-term replacement. However, to support furnishings manufacturers and testing
    organizations in product design and evaluation, and to assist regulators in the
    compliance evaluation process, a feasible and preferably non-agricultural ignition
    source with long-term availability is desirable. A key first step in establishing
    such a standard ignition source is examination of prior characterizations of smoldering
    ignition sources and the cigarette ignition process. This report documents a literature
    survey on these topics.
