abstract:
- content: 'John Daugman correctly summarized the state of forensic iris recognition
    circa 2006 for the book Forensic Human Identification: an Introduction by Thompson
    (CRC Press, 2006). Iris recognition has limited forensic value, because (unlike
    fingerprints or DNA, for example) (1) iris patterns are not left behind at crime
    scenes; (2) and in death the pupil usually dilates significantly, the cornea clouds,
    and the iris tissue degrades relatively rapidly. (3) Moreover, currently available
    iris databases are quite small (only a few million digitized samples of iris patterns
    exist today); and because of the novelty of this biometric, (4) such data currently
    has no legal or established forensic status as admissible evidence. [Numbers ()
    added.] In the intervening ?15 years, all of Daugman s observations, save one,
    have been overtaken by events: (1) The advent of ubiquitous high resolution video/photography
    has led to widespread collection/retention/dissemination of imagery of sufficient
    resolution for iris recognition. (2) Demonstrations of post-mortem iris recognition
    have been made. (3) Large iris databases have been constructed. The last issue
    (4) regarding admissible evidence remains to be resolved. Forensic iris was a
    topic at the June 2018 Iris Experts Group Meeting1. Key issues discussed there
    were: measurements and analysis that need to be done to provide the underpinnings
    for a resolution of the forensic status of iris recognition and the development
    of documentation for such measurements and analysis that will enable explanation
    of iris collection and recognition to lay audiences, including those in a courtroom.
    An important point was that the perceptions of the public and the popular media
    with respect to biometrics and to iris recognition in particular are frequently
    inaccurate and must be considered in any development of materials designed to
    explain iris recognition to the lay public. To help resolve the questions discussed
    at that meeting, this paper reviews the current state of the art in iris recognition,
    the perceptions of the public regarding iris recognition, and makes suggestions
    regarding measurements and analysis that will help enable use of forensic iris
    in appropriate settings going forward. We welcome comments for the next revision
    of this document. Please send comments to james.matey@nist.gov.'
