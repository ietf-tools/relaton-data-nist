abstract:
- content: An international workshop on the backfill A component of a multi-barrier
    under-ground isolation system for nuclear waste disposal/storage was conducted
    on April 13 and 14, 1981, at the National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC.
    This report includes the papers presented and/or submitted to the workshop for
    publication. It also contains the surveyed results of a questionnaire distributed
    to the participants at the workshop. The workshop held a one-day informal indepth
    discussion on the subject and a summary of these discussions is included in this
    report, which states areas where further research and development needs are required
    to better understand the fundamental mechanisms of the backfill in the waste repository.
