abstract:
- content: The three categories of critical facilities addressed in this document
    are hospitals, K-12 educational facilities, and data centers. This review focuses
    on both requirements for new building design as well as for existing building
    renovations or additions for the flood, wind, and seismic hazards. An overall
    review of current design practices for these three categories of critical facilities
    within our communities is discussed, along with some of the best practices currently
    being utilized to provide more resilience within these facilities. The target
    audience of this report includes industry associations, design professionals,
    building code officials, city planners, and researchers.
