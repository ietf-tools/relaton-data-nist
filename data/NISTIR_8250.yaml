abstract:
- content: 'This publication contains standard operating procedures for calibrations
    that were not previously published in other NIST Office of Weights and Measures
    publications and are included here in support of weights and measures laboratory
    program requirements to ensure suitable metrological traceability, and uncertainty
    in calibrations. The current and proposed procedures cover a variety of measurement
    parameters including: time and frequency, electricity, mass, force, volume, dimensional,
    thermodynamic, pressure, liquid and solid density, and magnetism in mass standards.'
