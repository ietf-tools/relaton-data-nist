abstract:
- content: Nondestructive test (NDT) methods and sensor technologies are evaluated
    in the context of providing input parameters to service life prediction models
    for reinforced concrete structures. Relevant NDT methods and sensors are identified
    that are based on diverse technologies including mechanical impact, ultrasonic
    waves, electromagnetic waves, nuclear, and chemical and electrical methods. The
    degradation scenarios of reinforcement corrosion, alkali-silica reaction, and
    cracking are used to identify gaps in available NDT methods for supporting condition
    assessment and service life prediction. Common gaps are identified, along with
    strategies for resolving those gaps.
