abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2367 is intended for use in the value
    assignment of JC (John Cunningham) virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to JC virus
    DNA controls and standards. A unit of SRM 2367 consists of a well characterized,
    linearized plasmid, containing JC virus DNA solubilized in 10 mmol/L 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3
    propanediol hydrochloride (Tris HCl) and 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
    disodium salt (disodium EDTA) pH 8.0 buffer (TE), with 50 ng/?L yeast tRNA added
    to ensure stability. A unit of the SRM consists of one 0.5 mL tube containing
    approximately 110 ?L of DNA solution. The tube is labeled and is sealed with a
    screw cap. This publication documents the production, analytical methods, and
    statistical evaluations involved in producing this SRM.
