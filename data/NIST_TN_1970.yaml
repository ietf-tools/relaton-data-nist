abstract:
- content: The Intelligent Building Agents Laboratory (IBAL) has been designed to
    demonstrate the potential for distributed, intelligent software agents to perform
    optimization of control systems in commercial buildings. This technical note discusses
    the methodology used to assess the time- dependent variability of measurement
    devices in the IBAL. The total uncertainty is calculated by combining this variability
    with the uncertainty of the instrumentation.
