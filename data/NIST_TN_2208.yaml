abstract:
- content: Work-place MusculoSkeletal Disorders (WMSD) continue to be the most significant
    source of industrial work force injuries. Exoskeletons are emerging as personal
    protective equipment (PPE) for sustained, repetitive, or intensive industrial
    tasks. This technical note describes and evaluates a proposed test method comprised
    of a novel testing apparatus, Position and Load Test Apparatus for Exoskeletons
    (PoLoTAE) designed and developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST), to simulate a wide variety of industrial tasks. The test method used commercially
    available, low-cost, readily adaptable sensors, building materials, and an initial
    set of qualitative and analytical methods to evaluate perceived user comfort,
    exoskeleton fit for task, and impact of exoskeleton on task productivity. The
    study includes analysis of simple subjective and quantitative measurement methods
    to obtain perceived comfort, effort, exoskeleton support, fit, task rate, and
    task completion times. Lastly, we include the limitations of this study and suggested
    improvements towards the development of test methods for the use of exoskeletons
    for industrial tasks towards providing more information for validation of models
    to understand the human-exoskeleton kinetic and kinematic interactions.
