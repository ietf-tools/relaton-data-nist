abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), participated
    in the Universal Communication Architecture International User Group (UCAIug)
    Interoperability (IOP) Test Event on October 14-19, 2017 in New Orleans, Louisiana.
    The objective of the event was to bring the multitude of current substation equipment
    implementations based upon the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
    61850 standard for substation communications capabilities to determine if the
    equipment can interoperate and perform cooperatively in a myriad of substation
    topology configurations to meet standards and industry requirements.
