abstract:
- content: This Recommendation specifies key-establishment schemes using integer factorization
    cryptography (in particular, RSA). Both key-agreement and key transport schemes
    are specified for pairs of entities, and methods for key confirmation are included
    to provide assurance that both parties share the same keying material. In addition,
    the security properties associated with each scheme are provided.
