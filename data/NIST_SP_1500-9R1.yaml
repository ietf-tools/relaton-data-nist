abstract:
- content: 'This document summarizes interfaces that are instrumental for the interaction
    with Clouds, Containers, and High Performance Computing (HPC) systems to manage
    virtual clusters to support the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA).
    The REpresentational State Transfer (REST) paradigm is used to define these interfaces,
    allowing easy integration and adoption by a wide variety of frameworks. Big Data
    is a term used to describe extensive datasets, primarily in the characteristics
    of volume, variety, velocity, and/or variability. While opportunities exist with
    Big Data, the data characteristics can overwhelm traditional technical approaches,
    and the growth of data is outpacing scientific and technological advances in data
    analytics. To advance progress in Big Data, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group
    (NBD-PWG) is working to develop consensus on important fundamental concepts related
    to Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework
    (NBDIF) series of volumes. This volume, Volume 8, uses the work performed by the
    NBD-PWG to identify objects instrumental for the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture
    (NBDRA) which is introduced in the NBDIF: Volume 6, Reference Architecture.'
