abstract:
- content: 'From 1984 to 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program (MMQAP) coordinated
    79 Round Robin (RR) interlaboratory studies designed to improve measurement comparability
    among laboratories measuring fat soluble vitamins and carotenoids in human serum
    and plasma. There were 22 participants in the initial study; participation increased
    to 58 in 1997 and then declined in stages to 29 by 2017. A total of 138 academic,
    commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organizations actively participated
    in at least one RR; two laboratories participated in 77 of the 79 RRs. A total
    of 350 human serum or plasma samples were distributed in the RRs, typically three
    to five per RR. One hundred thirty one (131) of these samples were unique materials.
    While the initial RRs focused on just retinol (vitamin A), ? tocopherol (vitamin
    E), and ? carotene (provitamin A) over the life of the program 57 vitamin related
    measurands were reported at least once. Fifteen (15) measurands were reported
    sufficiently often to enable analysis of measurement performance over time: total
    retinol, retinyl palmitate, ? tocopherol, ? plus ? tocopherol, total ? carotene,
    trans ? carotene, total cis ? carotene, total ? carotene, total lycopene, trans
    lycopene, total ? cryptoxanthin, total lutein, total zeaxanthin, total lutein
    plus zeaxanthin, and coenzyme Q10. In addition to documenting the number and nature
    of the MMQAP''s participants, measurands, materials, and reported measurements,
    this report explores the evolution of among-participant concordance and within-participant
    apparent precision as functions of calendar date documents and the relationships
    among results reported for materials delivered to participants both as liquid-frozen
    and lyophilized samples.'
