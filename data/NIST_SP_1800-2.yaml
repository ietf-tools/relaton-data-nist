abstract:
- content: To protect power generation, transmission, and distribution, energy companies
    need to control physical and logical access to their resources, including buildings,
    equipment, information technology (IT), and operational technology (OT). They
    must authenticate authorized individuals to the devices and facilities to which
    they are giving access rights with a high degree of certainty. In addition, they
    need to enforce access control policies (e.g., allow, deny, inquire further) consistently,
    uniformly, and quickly across all of their resources. This project resulted from
    direct dialog among NCCoE staff and members of the electricity subsector, mainly
    from electric power companies and those who provide equipment and/or services
    to them. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a converged, standards-based
    technical approach that unifies identity and access management (IdAM) functions
    across OT networks, physical access control systems (PACS), and IT systems. These
    networks often operate independently, which can result in identity and access
    information disparity, increased costs, inefficiencies, and loss of capacity and
    service delivery capability. This guide describes our collaborative efforts with
    technology providers and electric utility stakeholders to address the security
    challenges energy providers face in the core function of IdAM. It offers a technical
    approach to meeting the challenge and also incorporates a business value mind-set
    by identifying the strategic considerations involved in implementing new technologies.
    This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular, open, end-to-end example
    solution that can be tailored and implemented by energy providers of varying sizes
    and sophistication. It shows energy providers how we met the challenge using open
    source and commercially available tools and technologies that are consistent with
    cybersecurity standards.
