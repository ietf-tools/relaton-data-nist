abstract:
- content: This report of the Advanced Communications Technologies Working Group of
    the Interagency Committee on Standards Policy (ICSP) provides an overview of Federal
    agency advanced communications technologies (ACT) standards activities and recommends
    standards priority areas for ICSP consideration. The ACT standards priorities
    recommendations section of the report sets out nine areas for consideration by
    the ICSP. The landscape review section provides an overview of each contributing
    agency's relevant ACT standards activities, including its mission, ACT goals,
    role in ACT standards, participation in standards development organizations, ACT
    focus areas, and examples of standards activities for each contributing Federal
    agency or office.
