abstract:
- content: The purpose of rigid-body registration is to find a rotation and translation
    which transforms one coordinate frame to another. The procedure requires measurement
    of common points (fiducials) in both frames. Noise and possible bias in the acquired
    locations of fiducials adversely affect the quality of registration. While the
    influence of noise can be mitigated by taking repeated measurements, bias remains
    in the mean locations of fiducials and distorts the rigid-body condition. The
    condition may be also violated when fiducials are attached to a non-rigid object.
    We present a numerical method which calculates corrections in the locations of
    measured fiducials and leads to the restoration of the rigid-body condition. Once
    the registration transformation is calculated using the corrected fiducials, it
    can be used to transform other points which are measured only in one coordinate
    frame (target points). We estimate the corrections in these points by linearly
    interpolating the corrections from neighboring fiducials. After interpolated corrections
    are added to the target locations, there was a decrease in the target registration
    error. The proposed method was evaluated using three different datasets acquired
    with three different instruments.
