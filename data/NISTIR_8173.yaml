abstract:
- content: This report documents the Face in Video Evaluation (FIVE), an independent,
    public test of face recognition of non-cooperating subjects who are recorded passively
    and are mostly oblivious to the presence of cameras. The report enumerates accuracy
    and speed of face recognition algorithms applied to the identification of persons
    appearing in video sequences drawn from six different video datasets mostly sequestered
    at NIST. These datasets represent video surveillance, chokepoint, and social media
    applications of the technology. In six cases, videos from fixed cameras are searched
    against portrait-style photographs of up to 48 000 enrolled identities. In one
    case, videos are searched against faces enrolled from other videos. Additionally,
    the effect of supplementing enrollment with non-frontal images is examined.
