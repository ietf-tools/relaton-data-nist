abstract:
- content: This Guide Brief provides an example of how to determine the anticipated
    performance of water and wastewater systems subjected to an earthquake and tsunami
    event. The methodology used for this can be applied to all infrastructure systems.
    The example demonstrates the information required to complete the performance
    goals tables and establish the existing system performance that needs to be completed
    for building clusters and supporting infrastructure systems. This Guide Brief
    is intended to be read following an introduction to the topic in Guide Brief 29,
    Determine Anticipated Performance. It can also applied with Section 16 in Volume
    II of the Guide.
