abstract:
- content: The goal of the work was to determine the flammability of R1234ze(E) (C3H2F4)
    per the Japanese High Pressure Gas Law (see Appendix I). Tests were also performed
    with R32 (CH2F2), R134a (C2H2F4) and methane (CH4), to provide a baseline for
    comparison of the results with R1234ze(E). Since the measured flammability of
    the mixture might be affected by the ignition source, tests were conducted with
    either copper wire (0.08 mm or 0.361 mm diameter), tungsten wire (0.3 mm diameter)
    or the standard platinum wire (0.3 mm diameter). To aid in the interpretation
    of the experiments, calculations were also performed for the thermodynamic equilibrium
    conditions, the homogeneous autoignition time ?ign, the overall chemical rate
    from stirred-reactor simulations, and the laminar burning velocity. These latter
    simulations employed a detailed chemical kinetic model, and solved the conservation
    equations for mass, energy, and species conservation.
