abstract:
- content: The special publication contains complete papers on the subjects presented
    at the seminar, providing more of the technical details. For the sessions on Precisioin
    Waveform Synthesis, Precision Waveform Sampling, and Data Converter Characterization,
    six formal papers are given describing the hardware and software techniques used
    for developing NBS laboratory standards and apparatus for testing ac sources and
    voltmeters, phase angle meters, transient waveform recorders, wideband wattmeters,
    and digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters. For the informal session
    on Instrumentation Metrology, three subsequent papers have been written for publication
    which are included for completeness in the Appendices.
