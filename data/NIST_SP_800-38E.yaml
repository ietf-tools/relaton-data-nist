abstract:
- content: This publication approves the XTS-AES mode of the AES algorithm by reference
    to IEEE Std 1619-2007, subject to one additional requirement, as an option for
    protecting the confidentiality of data on storage devices. The mode does not provide
    authentication of the data or its source.
