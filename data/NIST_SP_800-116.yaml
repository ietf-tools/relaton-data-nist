abstract:
- content: This document provides best practice guidelines for integrating the PIV
    Card with the physical access control systems (PACS) that authenticate the cardholders
    in Federal facilities. Specifically, this document recommends a risk-based approach
    for selecting appropriate PIV authentication mechanisms to manage physical access
    to Federal government facilities and assets. This document also proposes a PIV
    implementation maturity model to measure the progress of facility and agency implementations.
